No es un camping muy agetreado ni con actividades .Tiene piscina muy cuidada y arbolada una pista de tenis de pago y un campo de futbito .\nYo lo tengo de fines de semana y para descansar de los agobios de la ciudad a 50 min de Zaragoza y 20 de Calatayud. Buen ambiente y buena gente , un espacio de naturaleza y si quieres hacer excursiones y patear montaña perfecto.  Recomendado para familias con niños ya que no hay peligros ."

      "Great camperplace before the actual campsite. With good accessability to camper service station. Nice facilities all over. And near the beach.",
      "Camp site with modern facilities and nice surroundings but unfortunately with very unprofessional staff. As we checked-in we were asked for a camping card. After 3 weeks spent in Norway and partially Germany and Denmatk where we never needed any card we realized we have some older camping card which we already used once on our trip to Norway in Denmark. We showed up the card the young lady who asked us whether we already used the card this year what we did once this year in Denmark few weeks ago just to make the registration in camping faster. Lady yold us the card needs to be updated but it wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately she didn't tell us this would cost us 160Kr! If we had known that we would rather move to another camping around. Anothet minor thing is we used only 0.1Kw/h of electricity but we paid 2Kr which is strange if 1Kw/h costs 3.5Kr.\nAt last we have an updated camping card for 160Kr which is totally useless as it is not accepted almost anywhere and we're on our way home after 3 weeks in Norway where we definitely won't use it this year.",

Felt a little out of place staying in a tent as most of the guests, like all of the campsites on my trip I stayed at, were staying in motor homes or caravans.\n\nIt's not far out of the town either so it's easy to get to and only a short drive from other places of interest in the area."

The cleaning lady seems to mop the floor and that's it. It smelled like someone peed on the whole floor and the urinal was so dirty I almost threw up. Part of the problem is also the bon existent ventilation in the service building, if someone uses the shower everything is dripping from condensation for hours.\n\nNot going back, not even for a single night.",

Our experience was wonderful, and maybe not the last one there",

It just so lovely camp site with one of the best and freshest service buildings I've ever seen. \nThere are 4 small lakes with planted fish, football golf, soccer field, log powered sauna and outdoor hot bath and wonderful surrounding for walks, runs or bicycle rides and 2 playgrounds for the kids. \nThe camp site is run and managed 2 of the loveliest  couples you can ever imagine. \nI do recommend this camp site for everyone. Young, middle aged or senior, with or without kids, camper, tent or RV. This site is for you.",

We came to this Camping ground at sunday evening and everybody was happy to get there. Although the village was cold and empty, we didnt expect much from that campingsite. i asked for the price for the night and was told it's 18,5€ for adult, thats ok. 4,5€ for the children, im ok with that. And... 90€!! for our 2-axial caravan, per night! I asked the lady again. 90€? per night? She nodded, took her calculator and showed me proudly, 113€ for the night. I laughted and we went off.

Per non parlare del gustosissimo cibo che offre sia specialità del territorio che varie altre prelibatezze. L'alloggio in cui abbia passato la vacanza era accogliente e spazioso. Il campeggio poi si trova in un'ottima zona: poco distante dalla magnifica città di Riom e dalle terme di Chatel-Guyon.",
      "Bon endroit où séjourner. \nUn peu loin des centres d'intérêts importants de l'Auvergne. \nMais riche en animations et en activités, il comble les attentes de beaucoup de familles. \nJe déplore quand même le tarif un peu haut de certaines activités, et du snack. Dommageable!!!\nBien équipé en infrastructures, il manque un degrés ou deux  (voir 5) au douches.\n\nBref pour le prix, on peut souhaiter mieux mais on est pas sûre de le trouver. ..",
      "Excellent séjour passé au ranch des volcans. Camping calme dans un environnement verdoyant que du bonheur!!! Restauration d'excellente qualité avec une équipe dynamique, professionnelle et sympathique. Nous avons passé de très bonnes soirées sur la terrasse du restaurant qui est agréable. Le camping est très propre. Après avoir discuté avec les propriétaires des améliorations sont apportées tous les ans. Cette année un espace chevaux qui renforce encore plus l'esprit Ranch et que les enfants adorent!!! \nEnfin le camping est équipé d'un complexe aquatique comprenant 2 bassins et 1 pataugeoire.\nEn conclusion je vous conseille vivement cet endroit magnifique!!!",
      "Camping calme et propre. Activités et animations pour petits et grands, équipe souriante, de quoi passer un agréable séjour. Le restaurant proposait de bons plats mais ils arrivaient tièdes, presque froids, dommage! Proche de Volvic et sa zone commerciale et aussi à 25 minutes du Puy de Dôme et de Vulcania."

      "Très bon accueil de la part de BETTY. Depuis l'an dernier nous connaissons ce camping situé à Chateauneuf les Bains et nous en sommes très content. Pour notre part le camping est agréable et ce qui rend encore plus sympathique ce dernier c'est la gentillesse de BETTY qui se charge de vous recevoir rapidement, il suffit que vous lui passiez un coup de fil un peu avant votre arrivée, le numéro est sur le site du camping :) Ce camping Municipal que nous vous conseillons offre la possibilité aux novices comme nous de mettre quelques provisions au frais car à l'accueil deux réfrigérateurs sont à dispositions des occupants du site. Pas de problème en ce qui nous concerne au cours de ces quelques jours passés sous la tente avec électricité, douches chaudes et toilettes raisonnablement entretenues. Vous aurez le choix entre sanitaires dites à la \"turque\" ou une cuvette classique. Prenez quand même votre propre papier toilette car il n'est tout de même pas fourni par le camping (n'abusons tout de même pas de l'hospitalité !). Gérard un habitué du camping nous a dépanné d'une rallonge électrique l'an dernier et cette année nous en avions une mais nous avons oublié la prise \"européenne\" qu'il faut raccorder à la borne électrique du coup une âme charitable nous en a prêté une. Barbecue autorisé nous ne nous en sommes pas privé sans déranger qui que ce soit, nous avons même été imité par les gourmands. Aux alentours se trouvent de nombreux sites à visiter et la possibilité de pratiquer des activités telles que pêche, canöé kayak bateau plages aménagées escalades etc. Vraiment à essayer ce camping accueillant, pas excessif niveau prix,  à l'ombre lorsqu' il le faut où nous retournerons avec nos amis."

      "Een nacht verbleven op de \"natuur camping\" voor trekkerstentjes, leuke plek tussen de bomen met voldoende ruimte om de auto er naast te parkeren. Toiletten en douches zijn afgeschermd met een cijferslot welke je bij de inschrijving krijgt, even wennen dat je die moet onthouden/meenemen, maar blijkbaar is het nodig.\n\nOmgeving is goed, mooi meer met strandje, plekken om de hond uit te laten of om met de camper te staan.\n\nOok zijn er redelijk wat activiteiten die via de camping te regelen zijn zoals midgetgolf",
      "Trevlig miljö men personalen var ingen höjdare. Vår stuga var inte städad när vi checkade in. Hundhår på golv, soffa, bord och i sängar. Stora tovor med hundhår under möblerna. Vi går till receptionen och ber om att få stugan städad. Vi får till svar att vi skulle bokat allergisstugan om vi har problem med allergi. Vi sa att det minsta man kan begära är att de åtminstone städar, så efter suck, stånk och protest från killen i receptionen så lyckades vi tillslut få vår stuga. Att kylen i stugan slutade funka lite titt som tätt var också ett stort minus. Det fanns en liten liten extrakyl i stugan som vi tyvärr försent förstod varför den fanns där. Vi förstod alltså först efter att vår mat blivit förstörd. Man kan ju begära att de byter ut den trasiga kylen eller åtminstone skriver en lapp om att den är ur funktion. Ska tilläggas att lampan i kylen funkade och den var kall när vi kom. Men kylan funkade bara tillfälligt.",

      "Would've loved to give a better review because on first impressions this is a lovely site, but we have been unfortunately disappointed. Big shady pitches, but on arrival ours was littered with cigarette butts...friendly staff but terrible service, were twice refused the chance to order food from the on-site snack bar (\"we're closing soon\" while still open), toilets and showers unclean, mould in washing machines, and generally treated as an inconvenience because we were guests for only 2 nights. There is also a campsite dog which wanders around bothering guest who are cooking and eating and barks all day, scary for us as our 1 year old was attacked by a dog recently. Describing this as walking distance to Vichy is a stretch for anyone travelling with young children. The one star is for the pool which was clean and well maintained, plus the proximity to a local restaurant with amazing food and an outdoor play area for children.",

Très bon accueil, bel endroit bien situé ( possibilité de partir en vélo jusqu'aux très beaux parcs de vichy, possibilité de faire du canoë directement du camping)\r\nLes enfants ont adoré le mini club\r\nTrès bonnes animations \r\nSnack avec des boissons à des prix raisonnables\r\nBref on conseil vivement ce camping pour passer de bonnes vacances en famille",
      "Nous sommes au Camping Beau Rivage depuis le 8 juillet et nous sommes ravis de notre séjour. Nos enfants apprécient beaucoup les animations pour les petits et les grands, depuis l'année dernière nous venons au camping et nous reviendrons avec plaisir l'an prochain. Les responsables du camping sont des gens charmants à l'écoute et qui se donnent du mal pour nous satisfaire. Tout le personnel est très sympathique. Je recommande fortement le camping Beau Rivage à Bellerive sur Allier.",

Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt was auch unter anderem an der Gastwirtin gelegen hat. Es war ein toller Kurzaufenthalt und wir planen für das nächste Jahr ein wiederkommen.",
      "Verpauperd gebeuren. Douches met gordijnen die nog aan een paar haakjes vastzitten. Douchemunten voor 1 euro, op de heetste stand een beetje lauw water. In de WC's geen toiletpapier. Helft van de deuren kan niet op slot. Geen zeep en afdroog voorziening. Op terrein voor vaste staanplaatsen zijn veel verwilderde lege plekken. Op bezette plekken veel half vergane bouwsels. Voordeel: niet duur en goed bereikbaar vanaf A3 en A4.",

Ich bin sehr froh dagewesen zu sein und freue mich schon aufs nächste mal. Wir kommen  gerne wieder mit mehr Leute alleine schon um auch denen zu zeigen was es heisst wirkliche Gastfreundschaft genießen zu dürfen.",
      "Sehr zu empfehlen, mit einer etwas abgelegenen (5km bis Lohmar) aber schönen Lage im Bergischen Land. Wir waren 4 Jungs, 2 Zelte und haben einen ungestörten Platz direkt neben der Agger bekommen. Auch die Feuerstelle war weitestgehend unbesetzt. Die Besitzerin war immer sehr nett und hilfsbereit, ob es sich um etwas Öl handelte oder Tipps zur Besichtigung der Umgebung. Wer Feuer macht bekommt sogar mal 'ne Pommes spendiert. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder herkommen!",
      "Der Campingplatz an sich ist gut und sauber. Dennoch kann ich den Platz nicht empfehlen!!! Wir waren mit einer Jugendgruppe (4 Erwachsene, 6 Kinder da) und hatten vorher per Telefon reserviert. Wir haben alle in einem Zelt geschlafen, da es ein großes Zelt war, wäre ich durchaus auch bereit gewesen statt 4,50€ 9€ zu bezahlen.(Obwohl ich am Telefon das Zelt genau beschrieben hatte und die Besitzerin dort noch bestätigt hatte, dass dies als ein Zelt gerechnet werden würde) Die stark alkoholisierte Besitzerin war jedoch der Meinung 25€ für das Zelt, so wie den Erwachsenenpreis für alle unserer Gruppe (Die ältesten 2 Kinder sind 12 Jahre alt, die jüngsten 10 zu bezahlen) Zudem verlangte sie für die zuvor für 25ct pro Stück angebotenen Brötchen plötzlich 1€ pro Stück und das alles trotz dem Vorzeigen der Preise auf der Website und dem heftigen Protest aller anderen Anwesenden in der Kneipe. Zudem mussten wir uns von der Frau, die definitiv stark alkoholisiert war anschreien und beleidigen lassen. Dort werden wir definitiv nicht mehr übernachten und ich rate auch allen Anderen stark davon ab!!!"

De préférence, empruntez l'accès situé à la sortie (ou à l'entrée) de Pont Astier.\nLes parcelles sont de taille XXL et délimitées par des haies.\nLes sanitaires mériteraient d'être rénovés mais la reprise du camping en 2012 est encore trop récente  pour avoir eu le temps de le faire.\nVous trouverez aussi une cuisine à base de plats régionaux, savoureux et copieux dans le restaurant attenant au camping. \nLa base de loisirs ravira les enfants comme les grands puisque les campeurs ont accès à la piscine extérieure.\nIci les animaux sont bien considérés et appréciés. Ca mérite d'être souligné. C'est aussi un peu normal puisque le camping est situé dans une réserve naturelle et, si vous êtes un peu lève tôt, vous aurez surement la chance d'apercevoir des espèces sauvages à quelques mètres de la clôture.\nJe recommande donc ce camping pour un séjour court, moyen ou long pour découvrir la ville de Thiers et les monts du Livradois- Forez.\nEn ce qui nous concerne, nous y retournerons.",

      "Arrived late after 24 hours of traveling and about 4 hours sleep. Reception was closed and it was after calling hours so we pitched in a clearly free space, with the intention of paying in the morning. The owner comes down and starts yelling at us and threatening to call the police if we don't leave. This also was disrupting the surrounding campers. We left and found an excellent campsite 15 minutes away. Would never recommend this campsite. ",
      "It's ok for one night in transit, but not if you want to make your vacation here. We stayed for a few nights with our tent. To get there you have to walk for a few minutes through the wood (if you come by bus). There is a road, but it can get scarry at night, since there's noone there at that hour and no lights. This place is in the back yard of the hotel with the same name, is very little and untidy. There are mostly RVs there and almost no tents. The entrance door remains open during the night, because the toilets are outside near the road. For the toilets you get a key at check-in, so outsiders can't get inside. Because all of this, you do feel uneasy all the time during the night. The groundskeeper was there when we arrived (he was a bit rude, but we ignored that). That was the only time when we saw him in a few days. He had \"office hours\" every day from 9, but at 11 when we went to the city he still wasn't there. Other than that there is noone from the staff there. Noone takes care of the restrooms for days. After the first day there was no soap left at the sink - then after two more days there was still no refill. To take a shower you have to buy tokens (1.2€ per shower) from the groundskeeper. One shower is supposed to last 6 minutes. But be aware of the fact that the token maschine for the women's shower is outside the restroom on the floor - so you have to put the token in, run to the shower and by the time you start the shower you probably only have half of the time left. When the time is up, the water gets cold. Also, there is only one shower. It was never crowded (there are really only a few people in the whole camping), so that wasn't a problem. \nSome people complain about the traffic noise. I've experienced worse, so I didn't find it that bad here. Earplugs always help.\nSo overall, I wouldn't go again to this camping. As far as I know, there is another one on the other side of Hattingen, where there are more people. ",
      "We have never been treated more rudely  than we experienced on this site. We arrived in the break, but they refererd to a phonenumber. Here they said they were all full, even though at least 10 pitched were free. As we were looking up an alternative site, the manager came and asked us to leave in a foul language.    Unbelievable. Don't ever go there.",
      "Was here a few years ago and then it was ok. Toilets were across the track from the site and OK, but feeling a bit worn. Like many German sites it was full of permanent touring caravans. OK yet a little strange. Warden didn't speak much English.",
      "1a Platz. Haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt. Super saubere Sanitäranlagen. Altstadt ist gut zu Fuß erreichbar. Nette Betreiber und faire Preise. Kommen gerne wieder 😙"

      "This state park is amazingly clean and well kept. The paths are easy to walk on and most are new concrete sidewalks or boardwalks. Our toddler had an easy time walking the small trails. The restrooms are stocked and cleaned daily. There are around 25 campsites, so it's not overcrowded and it's very enjoyable. Make reservations in advance! We had number 14 and it was perfect for 2 canopies and a 6 man tent. The waterfall was beautiful and we can't wait to come back whwn it's flowing full. I highly recommend a stay here!",
      "While the waterfall in all its glory can be impressive, the waterfall can also be a mere trickle if it hasn't rained in a week or so.  It's best to come here right after heavy rains.  The park itself is also very small acreage wise.  There is a campground, the waterfall, and a small lake, with footpaths connecting all three.  The lake itself is small and pretty dark water...there are several better places to swim within an hour of here.  The trails are basically a boardwalk and sidewalk.  Any off-road trails were closed when we visited.  It's definitely a must-do if you are in the area, but you could spend less than an hour and see/walk everything if you move at a moderate pace.",

      "I grew up fishing this lake. Great place to go to get away as well as catch fish",
      "Great fishing !!",
      "Absolutely one of those gems of a little RV park that alot of people would like to find. The spaces are large, landscaped and all face the evening sunset over a beautiful lake, is full of several different species.  It is hard to find this type of park and to really top that off are the owners, very friendly and helpful. Will be back this way and look forward to meeting the owners and catching some more of those huge shellcrackers, brim, bluegill and catfish. Happy Trails!",
      "Quiet, well run, friendly owner, roomy, on a good fishing lake, good services except for the lack of an onsite or nearby laundry."

      "We love Pine Lake RV Park. We moved from our home on the beach to enjoy peace and quiet. The campground is well kept. The staff go out of their way to be helpful and kind. Even when they get the occasional unpleasant guest, they are treated with the same kindness. Very clean campground. We stayed during hurricane Irma, it was a very stressful time however the staff worked around the clock to try to provide a safe and comforting environment for everyone. I personally seen the manager work and keep the office open and restrooms spotless 16 to 18 hours a day. I seen the maintenance staff working daylight to dark cleaning, mowing, and fixing the property to accommodate everyone's needs. Never complaining. The staff was pumping propane in the rain and high winds. Helping guest set up. No place is perfect but the staff made the best of what they had to work with. I love this place. Thank you Barbara and Buddy for running that place like all campgrounds should be ran. Y'all do an awesome job.",
      "I stayed at this park for roughly 3 months . During the summer . A few years back and again for 3 weeks in may . I love the park and the awesome people running it. They have gotten bad reviews from people who are down right crazy. And I say that in the nicest form .  I have see the lady in the office work day and night for weeks just to make sure everyone was safe happy etc. When they had issues with the water pump guess who went and bought water to make sure every guest had coffee or could use the restrooms .  The woman who runs the office .  The The maintenance man you will see all day walking the park or cutting the huge amounts of grass they have. They have rules like any other park.  But I can promise you they are far from the snuddy places you will find out on the road. The whole point of this park is they want everyone to be family and come back. And believe when I say once you stay and visit you will be begging to come back.  I know both my kids can't wait to go back .",
      "We stayed at Pine Lake RV Park in Fountain, Florida for 3 months. We really love this place. It is always nice and clean and They do everything they can for you to make your stay amazing!!!! They truly care about each and every one of their customers and the park is a beautiful place to stay and relax\nBob and Rene'",
      "We stayed here during hurricane Irma,  when we checked in we were given passport America price for two days ( which advertised 7 days). They said didn't have to honor PA during hurricane.  You would think they would have sympathy for people that had to evacuate NOT! The office staff were very rude. The grounds were not kept good at all. They advertise laundry room but all machines have been broken for years!! Omly stayed here because it was away from the storm. Very far from anywhere!!! Would not recommend this park!!!",
      "It started off great. Was here for 4 months, the last month our power went out due to their main breaker. I wasn't allowed to move to another lot for a whole month due to them being booked up which at the time didn't look booked up. We had to get a hotel and stay at friends for a month until they fixed power. Power never got fixed and they finally said we could move it. We lost over 200 dollars in food, went on vacation and came back to food stinking and rotten because of the power. The owners are very very cheap, rude and do not know how to run a good establishment. Theirs no festivities here, no fun room. Just a boring place, with everything going out constantly. Would never recommend this place, go into panama and theirs tons of wonderful places with activities, nice owners and huge ponds to actually fish in. Their also very kid friendly, this place was not. Wouldn't stay long nor short term. "

      "Outstanding place... $550 For dive classes if you're interested in being taught and certified. It's like a play ground for snorkeling and diving... and there isn't an \"attitude lines between the two activities... the divers welcome in the folks that are just swimming and snorkeling. The restrooms are sub par but functional in the right locations in the camp ground. Absolutely enjoyed out weekend here and will defiantly be back",
      "I was not excited about going there at first. Due to the cold temperature of the water. Once I was there I saw what  nice grounds and a facility they had. I St rated to lile the place already. Suited up, jumped in and yes it was cold but only for a minute or 2. Then I had a great time scuba diving. What a great place to go to and really clean water.",
      "I found this place by accident, because my dogs weren't welcome at Morrison Springs. But these people welcomed us and turned our frown upside down. What a great day! Diving! Swimming! Slides! Camping! Charming people! This place is definitely in my top 5 accidental discoveries. The world should know, people should stop here.😀",
      "Sept.22thre25 2017 camped in blue area had the best weekend. Had a little problem with there hook ups but they were on it  and fixed it. Enjoyed meeting every one and staff who came to our sites. The owners a staff were great. Can't wait till next year.keep up the good wrk.. loving all slides. Thank you vortex",
      "Great fun with my family in REALLY cold water. Loved it! Today was my first time back here in over 20 years. Lots of changes. All good. Last time I was here, the cost was $1 per carload. My family and I WILL be back! Thank ya!!"

The sites are the closest together I have ever been while camping, the noise from the highway is almost unbearable, they let people camp in vans/jeeps/cars, and their is nothing to do here.",

      "This park has been very helpful and friendly to evacuees! Even when their office staff were overwhelmed with stressed evacuees!\nI called a few days before we arrived to ensure they had a spot for us, owner took my info and logged us as coming.\n\nBecause they didn't take payment prior, I was afraid they might not save a spot for us.\nWe were evacuated from Florida a little earlier than I anticipated and we arrived a day sooner than expected....they had our spot assigned and ready for us when we got here! Even helped us into the spot.\n\nThe owners ensured that we had what we needed and were safe.\n\nThe full hook ups were certainly a relief in a time of stress.\nOnsite they offer propane, WIFI, laundry, showers, bagged ice, loaner DVDs, and more in the office. Don't be put off by the unassuming appearance of the office, this is a family run business trying to make a living like the rest of us.\n\nThe location is close to town, we were easily able to gather supplies and hunker down.\nWe will return again sometime! (when we are not running from a hurricane)\nBig Thanks to all A-Okay RV park staff",

When we needed to leave early because the storm was coming our way again they refunded our money for days not stayed.  It has no amenities except for a nice laundromat but has a pasture of long horn steers that is beautiful!  We stay in a motorhome and never look for amenities except when we have grandkids with us.  The sites are 75' by 50'.  You can't beat that!!",

Also said my kids couldnt be in the water. Yes my oldest son was walking around in the water but  there isnt a sign stating you can't . I guess the 30 plus pictures of people playing in the water on this site were trespassing too. \nThe owner said that we could only stop to take pictures well guess what we were doing taking pictures. Just like the rest of the people there that she walked past. She also stated there are signs up. Well we did see one sign as we left that said check in at office but it was on the other side from where we entered so how could we see it? \nWe just wanted to go relax some where and enjoy the day after spending a week at the \n hospital  watching my husband mom die. Thanks for making things even worse on my kids by being rude and ugly.  \nDon't worry we won't be back to trespass on your private property.",

The food was overpriced for what you got, when we finished our large burger that was not big at all, We ordered a chocolate milkshake which tasted like the cheapest chocolate ice cream you can buy with some milk, when we finished I went to pay for the food where the sign said Pay Here I stood there and the lady started yelling from inside saying she was waiting on me on the other side of the sign which looks like a place for only people that work there to go her attitude was terrible she looked like she weighed 400 pounds at least and the only interest she had was talking to her regular customer. If you are just passing by this is not a place you would want to go. Waitress seemed pretty nice and the people inside were very country-folk and seem Pleasant. If it wasn't for the overpriced food and then for the lady getting an attitude when it was time to pay it would have been okay. ",

We will never go back, and I'd advise you try somewhere else also... even the huddle house would be better!!",

      "Is a beautiful place where you can be separate from the routine and enjoy with God!!",
      "This place is a wonderful place that Denver,NC is very proud of. Every summer around mid July cabin owners start packing in for a month of congregating and worship of our Lord. Everyone is invited to service and listening to some wonderful gospel groups from all over perform. All the festivities are free of charge. The shack opens up and is run by volunteers and students from North Lincoln High School. They sell a wide variety of foods, sweet snacks and small trinket toys. Also around Christmas volunteers dress up and recreate Bethlehem. The RSCG is a must to add to your summer calendar and then again during Christmas break...xoxo ",

The only reason for not giving 5 stars is the host that checked us in...total jerk.  The other host was very friendly, but his counterpart really doesn't belong working at a public campground.  Beautiful spot close to everything you need. ",

It is $42 for every site whether 30, 50 amp or sewer/no sewer.  We paid $42 for water and 30 amp.\nAt least we were safe and they were great people employed there.",

      "Got there just before 5. No one in the office. Called the number and was told to just go to lot 8 or 9. We had a hard time finding the site. Then a man comes by and asks for the money. Cash or check only. No cable, wi fi is bad. $42 a night is too high for this place. Used to be $25   2 years ago. Will not come back."

      "If I could give it more than five stars I would. We were in the area for work and I called last minute to try to get a spot for the weekend. The owner (Jill) got back to me right away and was extremely helpful the whole time with all my questions. (Contrary to some of the negative reviews about communication). People need to understand that they have children and every day life to take care of, so she might not be staring at her phones at all times waiting for someone to call with a problem. Our stay was amazing and everything and more we could have hoped for. If you want to have privacy, amazing views, a pretty hiking trail, great fishing, and a true camping experience, then stop reading this and call her now. They could very easily have hundreds of campsites on their property, but they designed it so that you truly have privacy and it seems as though are the only ones out there. There is a town with everything you need only 10 minutes away in case you forget something. All in all it was a great experience and a great weekend. Will definitely be coming back!",
      "I have been here a few times and always have had a great experience. The owners Jill and Jan do a great job keeping the place picked up and are prompt to respond if something isn't right during your stay. We keep coming back here because we love that you cannot hear other campsites!!! There is plenty of space between sites so you are not on top of one another like some campgrounds. Will be returning for another visit.",
      "My girlfriend and I had such a peaceful, relaxing and fun time staying at the Buckhorn Cabin site at RoundStone. The grounds are beautiful to walk around. We took a day trip to Jim Thorpe to do white water rafting. Awesome little getaway and the owner Jill was great. She made the booking, etc seamless. Highly recommend.",
      "The campsite was great and peaceful up until we encountered a bear. After trying to contact the owner many  times we finally had to get in the car to find her house which was hidden in the woods. Was a great time until we encountered the bear many times, it kept coming back to our site. after  that we felt unsafe and decided to leave. Not only was the lady unprofessional and not answering the phone after us telling her there was a bear on our camp site. She took our money and didn't even refund us for the night we didn't stay because we were scared.",
      "Same thing as the rest of the people on here.  We had been going here for a few years and loved it.  Now all communication has stopped.  I have literally tried texting/calling 10-20 times with nothing back in return.\n\nIf you are looking to actually plan out a camping trip....... skip the headache here."

      "Disappointed..price high, quality low! Food cold, service slow.. The staff was seen outside when we arrived and when we walked in the place was a empty, we thought they were closed. We seated ourselves and the waitress came to us when she finished sending a text or whatever she was doing on her phone, never again. Portions were not what I paid for, the menu is not what one would expect. Not sure if they are changing it or just trying new things because business is so slow but they were offering a southern lunch plate!?!  Seemed strange. I doubt they will be in business long.",

Their cheese grits and grouper sandwich are so yummy. Onion rings are sweet and crispy. We will definitely be back. Savannah is an awesome server!",
      "Very lively atmosphere. Most of the wait staff is friendly and they have events such as karaoke very often. I suggest going when they have specials such as 1 dozen oysters on the half shell for 6.99. Appetizer portions are very small. I got 5 small shrimp with an amazing sauce on it for 7.99. Fried mushroom app had the same issue. Tasted amazing but they were sliced and fried, all together I got maybe 4 or 5 mushrooms and I wound up getting 2 orders. This time I got the fish tacos with the sauce that came on my fried shrimp app. Portion on the tacos was good as well as the fries that came with them. They came with large strips of grilled blackened grouper. Some of the best dish tacos I have had in a very long time. Over all I would give this place a 4/5. Will be going again.\n"

      "I really want to give 0 star but it is not possible. From check in the staffs were rude to us. We rented five tent sites. The weather was unusual on Sept 1st, 2017. It went down to 38 degree during night time. We were playing cards until 1:30 AM. When we went to sleep, we found out that electricity is not working. There is no way we cloud sleep without small heater on because of cold weather. We called the phone number we found online few times, no one answered the phone. We went to office which close at 11 PM but got the manager's number to call from near by pay phone. We called the owner / manager Debbie to check the electricity for us.  She came after about 10 to 15 minutes, she started yelling for no reason and she was in very bad mood and very bad attitude. I guess we disturbed her sleep. When she arrived one of the kids (about 2 years old) was crying because heater was not working and she wake up in middle of the night. Debbie (manager) told us the baby can't cry and it is quite time. What a non sense? Anyways, she has no clue what to do when electricity is not working and she started blaming us that we might have done something. She told us it might be a major issue and started blaming that we caused the issue. She told us this can't get fix and told us to stay without electricity. We had to explain her that we need heater because of kids. After few tries, she did something that fix the issue. We asked her that what was wrong? She was clue less. That made us all nervous because weather was very clod and we were with 7 kids. Anyways, we planned to camp for three night but short our trip to just one day. Next day the forecast predicated lot of rain and cold weather, so we thought if the electricity goes out again and if they can't fix it than the kids will be sick. After cleaning the sites, we ask them to check the sites. Again, the manager Debbie came to check the sites, she was very rude. The sites were even cleaner than even before we rented. She could not find anything wrong, so she show one pile of onion somewhere and asked us to pick up that. We were all looking at each other that how low someone people can go. We been to many other campsites. We have to clean the camp sites every where but they have cleaning staff who pick up some small left over garbage and inspect the site after guess check out. But I guess, they want to run the business with bare minimum staff. Anyways, they don't have any security after 11 PM. It is very hard to get help after 11 PM. That is red flag for security purpose. Also, during day time, I notice only one person picking up garbage and one lady cleaning restrooms. I could not find any other cleaning or helping staff on ground. Other camp sites have many more staffs. I think they want to run the business with maximum profit without worry about guest security or cleanness concern. Also, want to mention one more issue, we rented sites with water and electricity, but the water was not available per site. There was one water connection shared with five sites and also the water connection was far from site. Not convenient at all. Avoid if possible this camp ground.",
      "We love this campground. It's close to Mt.Airy casino, Pocono International Raceway, Kalahari water park, one-day road trips. The campground is well taken care of with a huge pool and a playground for the little ones. Very dog friendly. The owner and staff are super and plan functions and festivities thru out the season. We have been camping here since 2013.",
      "It's a very cramped place but the other campers are very friendly. The owner seemed grumpy and unfriendly. I smiled at her and she glared at me. \nThe best part about this campground was the small trail that led to an abandoned farm house. There wasn't any signs to mark the trail and the beautiful house had weeds growing around it. If it were more taken care of, it could be a gorgeous tourist attraction! \nI don't think we will be coming back here because it's so cramped.",
      "Owner is rude and tried to blame our kids for destroying the forest a pulling down a tree after hanging a volleyball net on it. We kept apologizing for the tree but she continuously kept yelling at us. I then had to step in and ask her if she did not think she was taking this a little too far and is over reacting. After I said to her that I don't believe that a volleyball net would be able to pull a tree down, she then started picking up broken twigs and branches from the floor saying we tore it down. Threatened to keep our deposit for that. I do not recommend this place at all. We reserved 5 camp sites I would think that she would at least treat us with respect. Friday night we were up late she drove by to tell us to keep it down. Saturday night we were trying to sleep and heard people making noise straight through the night. Nice camp ground, bad owners",
      "Just recently went camping with my family over the weekend and generally had a good experience with their cabins. It had proper heating and cooling at reasonable prices and cabins were clean at the time of our arrival. Downside is that there are very little staff and one staff member, Debby, whose poor and disrespectful attitude left a sour impression of this campsite. Per my family's experience, Debby was rude when my brother-in-law and my sister went into the main office to PURCHASE a ceramic to paint during the ceramic painting time. Even though he had gone in to purchase it after the ceramic painting time had started, there is a respectful way and manner to explain that it was simply too late to purchase a ceramic or simply, PUT THE CERAMIC PIECES AWAY SO PEOPLE DO NOT PURCHASE THEM. Although the main office woman took care of the purchase and was not rude to my sister and brother-in-law, it is sad to now know that the owner/manager could have such a  distasteful character. Secondly, it's unfortunate to note that the \"beer tasting\" session appeared to hold priority during the saturday activities on the campground meanwhile children activities were rushed or given little time to do. Thirdly, at time of check out, my family (separate cabin and payment account) was not allowed to check out until my other family member's cabin was checked and issues of cleanliness was resolved. We understand cabins need to be left as they were found, however, there was no such policy that should have restricted my personal family from being given our refundable deposit just because our other family member's cabin was not ready for check out (side note: a deposit is needed when you check in and is refunded to you if after inspection of the cabin, everything is as it was when you checked in). This issue that we had regarding our deposit  and being able to check out was rudely facilitated by the campgrounds wonderful owner or co-owner debby who rudely threw the cabin key on the desk when my father gave it to her so we could check out. We also had a third family member who rented a separate cabin as well, and rudely told her to leave the campground because she had checked out even though she had only remained on the campsite (IN HER MOTHERS CABIN) to help her mother finish cleaning up her cabin. She even had the audacity to tell my third family member that if she did not leave the campground she would charge ONE DOLLAR per hour??!?!? what kind of owner or manager says and acts in that kind of disgusting way towards her customers????? I'm not sure if this is a race issue or not, but whoever works with her or is co-owner of this campsite, need to re-evaluate who you are working with or for. From reading other reviews this is not Debby's first rodeo with poor customer service, so if it's your first time and you're looking into this place, i'd pass. Debby should learn a thing or two from her other staff members who I should say were pleasant and treated my family respectfully. This purely reflects on the character and behavior of this campgrounds owner and has unfortunately turned us away from ever coming back and will share this experience with other friends and family."

It turns out that it wasn't as close as I expected.  But no big deal we were already packed to camp.   I was pleasantly surprised at the overall cleanliness of the bathhouse, pool and playground.  It has to be difficult to maintain a large area with an influx of people.  Our camp area was up front and directly across from the bathhouse.  They had a washer and dryer which was handy. Picnic table and fire pit at camp site.  Bring your own grill cover,  mine was too small. We had skewers so no problem.  Electrical outlet was great for charging iPads, TV and water heater for morning coffee.   The pool was clean and clear.  All the imenities of home in the rough.  It's not posh but if you are camping, is it supposed to be?  The kid's had a great time so that's what counts.",

      "We had a great time for a weekend getaway. The area was well kept and clean. The bath house, rec room, and laundry room were very classy. The setting was a very peaceful and pretty. I've recommended this site to all my RV buddies.",
      "Loved this place! Beautiful scenic views and plenty of places to go, and be, and just waste the day away. The cabin we stayed in was the Victorian, and it was just awesome! Clean through and through, but there were some areas the cabin lacked that could have made our stay a little more convenient.\n\nWhen we got here, the windows facing the lake were so dirty we couldn't see the lake through the glass. The bedroom door with the king bed does not lock, and the bathroom door to the queen does not close or lock. When opening the second door to the queen bedroom, the force of the door opening opens the door to the bathroom, and anyone in there is exposed to the kitchen and whoever is in it. Also we really loved the shower and the bathrooms, they were very well done. But there is nowhere to hang our towels or bathing suits. Some hooks on the wall or a rack in the bathroom for hanging wet towels/clothes would go a long way. We had to hang our clothes and towels on the door hinges or off the bedside table built into the headboard. Also, the rules state that we are not allowed to bring our towels (the ones provided by the camp) to the pool. However, the information on the website claims that they have everything you need, and didn't say anything about bringing our own towels just to swim. We didn't bring our own towels so we had to go buy some. Same with the blanket on the bed unfortunately. We were told linens were provided. When we got here and saw the blanket they gave us was very thin. We ran to the store and bought a blanket too because we knew we would get cold (the blanket was like a napkin). There was no dish soap for the kitchen, so we had to buy that too. I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom sink (king bedroom) and cupped some water in my hands, and the water was cloudy for some reason.\n\nWould I come back? Absolutely. I just think that there could have been a little more attention to detail. These small changes make a big difference in the end though. Being able to do dishes and hang wet clothes, so they don't wind up on the floor, are small things that in the end, add up to a great vacation.\n\nWe had a great time and we will definitely suggest this place to friends and family!",
      "The suites are awesome! Very clean and comfortable. We stayed here last week, and enjoyed the most relaxing vacation we have had since we took a cruise. The resort is off the beaten path, but oh so worth the drive. If your vacation goal is to relax, you won't be disappointed!",
      "We stayed in the \"Glamping\" tent and it was wonderful! Amazing views and the bed is cozy. The pool and extra bathrooms were also nice and clean. The whole place is just a step above other RV parks.",
      " Awesome people, great location, excellent fishing,  and big bugs lol. Definitely going to come back here again. "

      "This place is next to the fleamarket where I buy stuff at.",
      "I've camped at VFW for the last 6 years during Merlefest. The staff is beyond friendly, the breakfasts are great (biscuits, eggs, bacon,  gravy), the showers are almost always hot, and the buses to and from the festival run on time. There's usually firewood and ice for sale at the entrance, and you can hear music drifting up to the tent camping from the RVs down below. We don't plan to camp anywhere else as long as we're attending Merlefest.\n\nA word of advice: If you're tent camping, bring your own paper towels, toilet paper, and hand soap for the bathroom! For all their strong suits, checking on the bathrooms is not one of them. Soap dispensers were full the whole time, but the soap had ... congealed? in the dispensers and wouldn't come out. Pretty gross. I only saw paper towels in the dispensers once during the 4 nights I was there.",

      "This is a wonderful campground.  I found the campground by looking around on the internet.  Being from Colorado camping in PA is completely different.  A lot of the sites and campgrounds are so close together that you literally are camping with your neighbor.  I didn't find that here.  The owners are super nice and take great care of their property from the grounds to the pool and restrooms.  To have clean hot showers is a really nice feature. I really enjoy that there is firewood available to buy at the site so your not on the hunt while getting there.  Tried the put put course and that was a lot of fun as well, but you can't beat the giant metal slide closer to the entrance of the grounds.  Even though it is about 2 miles from the speedway there wasn't a lot of noise from the events.  I am happy I found the camp grounds here, and plan to return.  Even with my sister who is not much of a camper!",
      "Great place to camp with the family. Sites are spaced well. Would be nice to have additional bathhouse.",
      "Owners/staff are very nice people. Plenty of space between sites. Facilities were clean. Sewer connections were a little too high and roads are fairly rough. Didn't use the Wi-Fi and had a fair choice of channels on over the air TV. And an added bonus is veterans get a much appreciated discount.",
      "Very nice little campground. Iess than 1 mile to the Pocono raceway. Sites are a little small, but being in a wooden area makes up for it. ",
      "Was not happy with our visit. First let me say that this review is based on our experience and what we like in a campground. And i understand completely that others will have different opinons.\n\nWe went this passed memorial day weekend. The place was PACKED! (Understandably) The sites are VERY close together. There was a line of about 5 small trees that divided us from our neighbors. Our firepit was literally 6 feet from our neighbors tent. It was made of stone and dug into the ground so it couldn't be moved. Needless to say we felt cramped all weekend long.\n\n We did like all the surrounding woods and wildlife. We saw deer, chipmunks and birds.\n\nThe roads within the campground are all oneway. And NO-ONE seems to understand that. All weekend we were dodging around cars coming up the wrong way.\n\nThere were many contradictions to the name \"peaceful woodlands\". There were a lot of loud atvs that just seemed to be randomly driving around. Hourds of kids aimlessly roaming the grounds being excessively loud. And i guess there is no quite time. Our neighbors two sites up were up till 2am drinking and arguing about politicts, race and the legalization of heroin. Then about 3 am a few others in another group further down got into a very enraged shouting match...\n\n The one bathhouse all the way in the front of the ground was probably the worst i have seen yet. Aside from outhouses. It was like someone soaked the entire place down with a hose every hour. But missed the floor as it was covered in muddy footprints. One of the three  toilets was clogged almost all weekend. And paper towls and toilet paper were always empty except once. We didnt dare shower there...\n\n Like i said these are my observances and experiences. Others may like these kind of things. We don't. I do understand a holiday weekend makes campgrounds a lot more busy. But this just seemed to be too excessive for us.\n\n We will not be visiting Peaceful woodlands campground again."

Also didn't have picnic table at site and fire ring was just rocks on the ground. Couldn't get to lake to fish or enjoy it because all seasonal sites surround it.

      "My husband and I stayed over Labor Day weekend 2017.  The owner Berry is a great down to earth guy who keeps up the park and does a great job.  The first pics on the site were nothing like what we saw on our stay.  We saw nice green lawns and a play area for the little ones and an area for adults to play horse shoes and bad mitten. We enjoyed taking a nature hike up a nearby trail that led into the state park to several waterfalls.  The campsites were very spacious and firewood was available to purchase.  And the sites backed up to a creek. Pleanty of nature, great weather and r&r.  Worth a return visit for sure.",
      "Just got back from an AWESOME long weekend. Barry the owner is the nicest guy you will ever met. Clean/heated bath house lots of games for the kiddos. Will definitely be back and would highly recommend it to anybody that wamts to relax or hike stone mountain state park. He also has stalls to rent for your horses. LOVED IT.",
      "What a great camping experience! The owner is exceptionally friendly and accommodating. The bathrooms are new and well maintained. Having WiFi is the ultimate convenience. We look forward to staying here again on future climbing trips and recommending the campground to our clients. ",
      "Wow what a gem!  After buying our first travel trailer I researched a bunch on campgrounds in NC and I am SO happy we found this one.  The owner is so friendly and helpful, there are tons of outdoor lawn games for the family to play together and it literally takes about a 10 minute hike to get to the lower falls of stone mountain where my kids got to slide down a natural waterslide.  We all had so much fun and I cannot wait to come back.",

This is a family owned campground that strives to provide a clean, safe environment with many family activities. Bingo, pumpkin carving contests, hayrides, and other fun things. It's also 5 minutes to Cabella's superstore in Hamburg for a fun afternoon if it's raining. They also have multiple hiking trails that lead up to the pinnacle complete with a cave for exploring.",
      "The campground was super crowded, and I thought the sites were rather small.  I had to K-turn my truck & bumper pull camper to get in & out, which isn't a big deal for me... but could pose a problem for others.   The site was so small I couldn't fully open the 8'x12' outdoor carpet - even 1/2 way open.  LOTS and LOTS of kids playing & having fun through the wee hours of the night...  (I think it was that \"Man Hunt\" game)   So if you're looking for that kinda experience,  & have tons of kids... it'd be perfect...  but for quiet camping in the woods... not so much.",
      "Our group of 10 stayed May 13-17 and enjoyed our stay.  We had sites 149, 193, and 194.  The only downside was it rained for a couple of days and sites  193-195 turned into mud pits.   The bottom bathhouse is a little dated; but no issues with cleanliness. In fact, someone was cleaning every time I used it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Blue Rocks campground to friends and family.",
      "We, a family group of 16, spent the 4th of July and preceding weekend at the camp. The cabins we booked, so we had to pitch tents. Fortunately, we got an RV site with power and water hook-ups. Great place for family and kids. Enjoyed the hiking and nature all around and the rocks park were incredible. The kids absolutely loved it and we had a gala time. The Camp store is stocked up with supplies, in case you forget to bring anything. Men's washrooms next to the office have worn out and need modernization."

      "Not a private campground at all, all the sites are squished together and it seems like someone took their half acre back yard and crammed as many hookups into it as possible. We drove an hour and a half, and after seeing the campground we took 60 seconds to process it and think about it before the lady Lola turned bitter and asked us if we were taking it or not so that she could get on with her night. After we responded politely that we were taking a second to think about it because we lived an hour and a half away she responded with \"why don't you just go on home then and don't bother me with this anymore\" and turned us away and walked off. We were dumbfounded and drove back home, camping and fishing trip ruined. Do not suggest this place to anybody. ",

The name specks for it's self there are plenty of bass, ducks and other birds. The bath house is always clean and the washer and dryer work good. If you're looking for peace and quiet this is the place to be",

Very clean bathrooms and showers. Reasonably priced for such a great place. I would recommend for families with young kids, newbie campers, and anyone who prefers camping with a minimal cabin. \n\nLocation was also great. Jim Thorpe, awesome tourist town and Leighton nearby.\n\nI did have an issue that my card was charged for our remaining balance, even though I paid cash when we arrived. Which, these things can happen with any business, it's how it's handled that afterward that matters to me. Called and had it straightened out very smoothly and professionally with the staff.\n\nWould have loved to give them more stars.",

I would go back next time we are in the area. ",

Basically we had no where to camp first night because of their lack of communication. Not a happy camper.",

The place was clean though and friendly.",

      "Keep in mind, this review is being written in 2016 and we were there in 2014. That being said...this place is a dump. Literally. Unkempt and in desperate need of everything. The story we got was that the owner had become disabled and the guy/family that was in charge of the place was just keeping it going. (I guess) They were very friendly folks and tried their best to be accommodating. He (I don't recall names) spoke with a thick Pa. Dutch accent, which made it difficult to understand him, even though I had spent 20 years in south central Pa. Turns out he was in the demolition field, which explained all the crap/junk that looked as if it came from demolition sites. \nWe ended up staying, since we figured it was just a place to park the camper and sleep for two nights. Hopefully it has been cleaned up since we were there. It looked like the campground could have a lot of potential. I would do some investigation as to the condition of this place before committing.

I have to say it is one of the best campgrounds I have ever been too (been camping for 30 plus years)!! The owners and other campers were so friendly! thank you for an awesome weekend!!!",

They take pride in their campground and it is quite noticeable. The bathrooms are super clean and the campsites are always neat and clean and spacious. This is our favorite place to let the kids run around and its small enough that you know where they are at all times. They have fun activities including Zumba Saturday mornings.

Some Policies are downright porderline unlawful, and plan on being harrassed over nothing by the staff members on a power trip. Never will be returning, and also if you are a fisherman/wildlife enthusiast be prepared to be harrassed by a part time croocked sheriffs deputy that makes it his goal to ruin even a family's day of outdoor fun and fishing, thinking hes a game warden.

      "Never again. Bait and switch payment policy with credit card reservation on phone and then check or cash (from there ATM) demanded at check in. The owner was rude on two points within our 1st 15 minutes of arrival. There is no Wifi and pretty sure only Verizon cell phone coverage. Maybe they aim at season long campers reflecting off business via being ignorant, but unlike a lot of other PA campgrounds many of the spaces that look seasonal, are empty and many seasonal RV's are in poor condition. Very few spaces that look short term where full. All spots are back in, many on a very tight angle and a lot of electric boxes are attached to trees. Pavilion in park area is full of stuff looking like a flea market. Part of the roads to the campground in either direction are single lane.\nLet me clarify the bold faced lie of bait and switch payment. I reserved on phone. Janet, the owner, took info credit card and said: “We're in the process of switching to no credit cards and getting an ATM.” We arrive two days later. At arrival, I was ignored saying hi to a lady behind the counter with her back to me. This was Janet. When she finally turned around she was rude. I said I had a reservation and held out my credit card. Janet said “it’s cash or check only” and pointed saying “there’s an ATM outside”. As I write this review I’ve found on moyersgrovecg dot com it says “EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 2008: We NO LONGER ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. The reservation statement “we’re in the process of switching to no credit cards and getting an ATM” a point-blank lie. If you are willing to lie to new clients, strangers at the 1st meeting for 9 years and counting then your credibility is zero.\n2nd issue: We arrived at 6 pm and saw people leaving the pool with guy locking up the pool gates. The info said pool closes at 8 pm so my wife called to clarify confusion and ask “What time does the pool close? We just got here. This sign says 8 pm but it’s getting locked up now?” The answer was “it’s closed now” and basically hung up not giving us answer to the question “what time does the pool close”. We wanted to plan our 2nd day.\nThe owner has reviews on Facebook and Google as an ignorant old lady and a witch. Any business owner failing to respond to negative online reviews in today’s world just adds a layer of rudeness icing on a BS cake. Time is our most precious resource. Janet, thank you for wasting our time, setting my family into a bad mood for our entire stay."

Ours had enough room to sit but no real room if we had wanted to have a fire. The rec center and facilities are somewhat dated, but everything is well maintained and seems to be in good working order. There are also different pools for the adults and kids should you be a couple coming without kids and prefer a quieter experience. Noise within the campground also seems to be pretty good.

Unless you're rich & snobby stay away... Scotrun campground across the street has way better  amenities, costs less, is kid friendly, and a much nicer experience! STAY AWAY!",
      "Been here 2 days and finding the cleanest bathrooms and showers.  Nicest camp store.     Won at bingo  tonight.  Even better because my sister-in-law and mother in law are seasonal here so we got to spend time with them. ",
      "We have friends who have been seasonals here for several years and would visit them occasionally. It didn't take us look to become regular campers here. With many years of camping behind us,  we have never seen cleaner grounds, restrooms or campstore. The owners always have a greeting and smile for everyone and it is a pleasure dealing with the staff.  The children enjoy using the sporting equipment and games available for borrowing. The playground  is great and the sports field are huge. We had a blast at Bingo, the regulars could not have been any friendlier. Another plus is hand-dipped ice cream, so good and so many flavors. This campground is gated, we like the security that it provides. I am shaking my head about the previous review. Maybe she got up on the wrong side of the bed.  We will definitely return!",
      "Beautiful situated campground on a hill in the woods of Scotrun. A lot of shade. Playground present.",
      "The bathrooms couldn't be cleaner, the pool couldn't be any more sparkling, the people - staff AND regulars - couldn't have been nicer!  Peaceful, relaxing, good location for exploring the area. Thoroughly enjoyable extended weekend!"

When we arrive to check in we are told that they can't honor our reservation. They said that they don't allow that. Why take the reservation if not allowed. We had to call around to find another campground and we did that was a lot better. Carolina country campground saved our weekend ",
      "Over charge on cancelation\nWhile the representatives are quite friendly and courteous on the phone, the campground policies are somewhat unfriendly and antagonistic. After making a reservation and needing to cancel it two days later, the cancellation charge was $25.00. While this cancellation was made six weeks in advance, the charge was more than %50 of the nights stay. \nWhile this may be stated in their listing, it is five times higher that KOA and Coastal Georgia, twice as high as most state parks. \"We have to make a credit card entry each time \" was the reason given. For a \"Christian run Family Campground\" it seems to be neither. Shame on them!"

      "Nicest RV Park in Fairbanks.  Stayed 6 weeks, close to town and convenient to Fred Meyer shopping.  RV Park is part of the larger complex of cottages and restaurant.  The Restaurant/Bar on site is Chena Alaska Grill.  Food is a little pricey but really good.  They have a nice deck for dining as well.  Easy walk to Pikes Landing Restaurant for less expensive food.  Pikes also has a deck on the River.  The Princess Lodge is 1/2 way between the RV Park and Pikes, they have a restaurant and bar as well.  WIFI was excellent.  Cable was horrible, couldn't watch it at our site because it was so fuzzy.  Owners need to clear out or cut up and back the trees on the sites as well as get rid of the sticker bushes that are along some sites.  Seems like the owners also need to capitalize on the riverbank and build it up so guest have a comfortable place to sit and watch the river go buy.   We paid $52 a night in July and August.  Manager is very friendly and helpful.  Would stay again.",
      "Nice RV Park.  Haven't used their WiFi or cable, so can't comment on that.  Good water pressure, decent showers.  Plenty of washer and dryer, 3.00$ per load for each.  Sites are good sized.  ",
      "Convenient location. Grounds are well kept. Sites are close together but not quite on top each other. Staff friendly and helpful. Would return to this RV park again.",

      "Great USFS campground just off Hwy 20, about 35 miles west of Winthrop, and right outside North Cascades Nat'l Park. Good place to camp if you want to do some hiking and exploring in the Ross and Diablo Lakes areas.",
      "Got to Lone Fir ahead of my group to grab a first come, first serve site. After fully paying for the site for 4 days x $17 = $68, putting the tag up and go out to see WA pass for the afternoon, I came back to someone backing in an RV because the Ranger had come by and pulled the ticket. I followed all the rules, fully paid, but pulled site tab anyway. I haven't gotten any response from the Ranger station, left multiple voicemails, but no one seems to care. \nAnd there is no running water, no camp host and the bathroom ran out of TP. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a NF campground and I routinely camp & climb year round. And all of this over 4th July weekend, the busiest of all.",
      "28 yr Active Duty military, family camper, and world traveler here...Please Do NOT spend your money here.  It's not possible to fully explain my disappointment with the facilities and the owner.  I reviewed other customer reviews before submitting this, and I see a trend with ownership (Jeremy's) attitude towards his customers.  \n    I've never been to a campground that felt so much like a prison camp.  If you have a family with kids or dogs then be prepared for the owner, Jeremy, to loiter around your site and issue you a stern threat of \"kicking you out without a refund\" if there is any noise made after 10pm.  He is intolerant of any noise he can hear.  We found him standing in the dark near our site multiple times trying to eavesdrop...pretty creepy.\n    The RV sites are packed together with fire pits in the strangest locations.  This results in your campfire being behind your back bumper and often 5-10 ft away from your neighbors fire or camper.  There is only one restroom for the entire park, there aren't enough toilets/showers...and it was disgusting every time.   The campground is right next to the highway and you will be forced to hear/watch logging trucks and 4x4s blast by at high speed all night.  The \"free\" wireless is worthless and if you're there when it rains...expect 1-4 inch deep standing water throughout your site.  \n     We had 5 RV's leave the campground early and we refuse to return.  The night before we left I tried giving Jeremy honest helpful feedback...my tone was friendly and calm, but Jeremy became irate and began yelling.  He refused to listen and responded like a petulant child instead of a grown adult.  After he knew we were leaving he then said we were kicked out for being noisy, but admitted that nobody had complained of noise once.  He even went as far as insulting my military service.  Truly disappointed."

      "We had a very bad bear experience tent camping here.  After spending several days wilderness camping to peace and quiet in Glacier we got a campsite here for the last night of the season (we were the only tent campers).  They didn't warn us about bear precautions at all, but we ran into a local RV camper who said there had been a grizzly around on a fairly regular basis.  Though we kept all food separate from our tent area, we were woken up at midnight to 2 very agitated grizzly bears in our campground who had most likely been accustomed to feeding off of scraps in the area, and had to leave and spend the night in our car.  On top of all of this, the tent-sites were mostly littered with cow patties.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily dissuade someone with an RV from staying here (it looks like that makes up most of their customers anyways) but they should get rid of the tent-sites if they are not willing to maintain them and take the necessary bear precautions.",
      "This is a lovely, small Campground in the Glacier National Park. They have wonderful hiking trails, outstanding drives, and a pretty good restaurant as well. We were permitted to park our trailer near where the tent campers area was, and leave it while we went for a drive for the day. They even watched the trailer for us and did not charge us. In the morning I hiked my dog not too far away to where the horseback riding was available. I did not enter the horseback riding area. A large, territorial dog rushed out of the horse area toward my dog but was called back by a woman who came out of her trailer. It appeared she was the person in charge of the horseback riding. I said good morning and she did not respond to me, rather just glared at me. Well I'm sure the pup was just doing its job, I would never ride a horse there, due to her discourtesy. I prefer to spend my money where I am made to feel welcome. Yes, my dog was on a leash. No, her dog was not on a leash. We did meet two very friendly Park employees who had a trailer parked next to ours. They were so happy to recommend great drives and things to do in the park for us. They had an awesome dog named Marley who was an absolute angel. I would definitely revisit Glacier National Park and I would definitely stay in the park again. ",
      "We stayed in the dry camping area in our 25' motor home because there were no sites with hookups available.  I'm so glad there weren't!  The dry camping part of this campground felt like a state park.  There were trees and grass.  The sites were spacious with fire rings and picnic tables.  There were ample faucets to obtain water very close to our site. It wasn't noisy or crowded.  We loved it here and wished we had been able to  stay longer.",
      "The place is pretty dated in every respect. It's  in an area with  little to do other than drive through the GNP or hike. They had musical slots going on and we lost a whole day waiting for our new slot to become available. Very inconvenient  and a lot of trouble.We wanted to leave a day early and asked  for  refund on one night 48 hours in advance. But they absolutely do not let go o f your money under any circumstances. Would stay on the West side of Glacier  Park if had it to do over again. The only thing good here is a nice view.",
      "Restaurant too expensive..can't share the huge portions or they charge you for 2. Family style portion is 20 bucks and seniors can't eat that much. Only option is a sandwich or burger."

They said because people would leave the water running. I thought well then just put on shut off valves. Don't charge people. But then they explained that everyone is starting to charge for water and I thought in 5,000 miles, this was the first place to charge for showers. It just comes across as really cheap and I, personally, don't like cheap people. Other than that it was a nice place.",

      "I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 days at Blue Cedars RV Park & Campground. The thing that most impressed me was the women’s washroom! Clean. Clean. A long bank of sinks, one even lower than the rest to accommodation our youngsters. An adequate number of plug-ins, a bright environment, and hot showers were all part of the “plus”. Bonus; showers are included in the campsite fee. The outdoor pool was another bonus. I felt there was ample room at the individual campsites for folks like me not requiring hooks-up. The non-full services sites are adequate in size, close to a water tap, and have a table. The owner has placed a porta-pottie at a convenient location, away from the full-amenities washroom, allowing guests a shorter walk. I felt welcomed at this Park. There are trees, there is grass. When thanking the owner for a great time and commending him on a lovely campsite I was quite surprised when he mentioned some had complained. For what, I wondered? Because some have complained, I wanted to speak of my positive experience.",
      "This seemed like a place operating for maximum profit with the bare amenities and maintenance needed to get by.  I had to walk a long way to the dumpster to throw something away.  Garbage cans would be very helpful.  It sounded like we were camping next to a freeway, which meant not much sleep since we were tent camping.  Bad experience.",
      "I have no idea where all these folks who wrote good reviews stayed, but it wasn't here! Old guy in office is just plain rude.  Locks and unlocks office door when he doesn't want to be bothered. Place is filthy with debris, garbage in fire rings, dog poop, and our site had old patio mat that looks like it's been there for years. Wouldn't even let the dog walk on it. Pool is closed, looks like it hasn't been used in years and area is full of old tires and garbage.  Bathrooms looks like they may have been redone at some point, but they are moldy and smell now.  Wifi is a joke. Old guy probably turns that off and on as well.  Too many other campgrounds in area to stay here. ",
      "Hidden gem. Beautiful stalls, quiet. Showers on site. They even have quaint little cabins you can rent.",
      "We stayed as evacuees from Williams Lake for over a month. We have zero complaints. I'm shocked that so many people have so many complaints but I suppose most people will jump on the internet to complain at their easiest opportunity. Morley (the manager) and Christine were fantastic to our family and many others during the evacuation. They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and looked after. There was a broken board at the play ground, we mentioned it to them and it was fixed immediately. Yes there is some noise from the highway however you are staying close to town, that is part of camping close to town with Costco and other stores 5 minutes away!......this campground takes pets, they have no restrictions, the showers are not coin operated, therefore FREE. There is WiFI, it's great when the entire campground isn't full and using it but you can't fault the campground for what you think is poor internet as that will happen anywhere you have a large number of people using at once.  I witnessed the campground manager having to clean up garbage from sites where people were just irresponsible about leaving garbage out or leaving garbage behind when they check out. I witnessed him dealing with people on a few occasions over the course of our time there, I never once thought he was unpleasant. He is just to the point and honest, which I appreciate and some people just can't handle! My family will stay here again and this will be our preferred place to camp when we visit PG."

      "We were excited to stay here for two nights in August but had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances. I looked at the cancellation policy and saw that we would be paying a $25 cancellation fee but would get the rest back as we gave over a week's notice to cancel. I contacted the resort and received $6.50 back for one night minus the cancellation fee. I am still waiting for the full refund for the second night and the resort will not return any of my communications. I was excited about the place and was going to try again next year when we could reschedule our trip, but this will not be happening now. I had read the fine print and know about the cancellation fee, but the lack of communication about the refund for the second night is unacceptable. It's been over three weeks now. It's only $35, you'd think they'd just process the refund as we gave sufficient notice...",
      "Nice spot along the lake. Campsites had very little privacy. Lots of junk laying around which gave it a poor vibe. Aside from the new playground the park felt run down and rough. It's unfortunate as the area has potential. 50 plus for a night this was our most expensive stay and the worst park we have visited on our journey. Nice staff park needs to be upkept.",

Next to Williamson Lake, which is also open to people who are not staying on the campsite.\n\nWiFi range is limited to around 30 feet around the office, so you're out of luck if you get a spot towards the end of the site.\n\nDo bring your mosquito repellent, quiet waters will attract a lot of these pests during the warm season!",

      "We stayed the last week of September 2017. I've never stayed in a more beautiful camp, especially for the money. It is well manicured while still felling natural. If the Smurfs ever manage a campground, this is it, magical!  Radium hot springs pool & spa is only ten minutes away.  It's great for recharging & relaxing after a long day trip as it's open some seasons until 11 pm!\n\nCanyon RV Resort is the perfect launching point for day trips to the more expensive to stay at Banff & Chateau Lake Louise areas. Plus you get the gorgeous 90 plus minute drive. The exact drive time will vary depending on how much your crew stops to explore!  There are a dozen places to stop along the way to look out or hike along the emerald green Bow river on the way north to Lake Louise.",
      "Treated badly by owner, because we had reserved and then asked if they would have a site available by the creek when we arrived, even though we hadn't requested it in our reservation request. We were put in site#3 which was barely long enough for our fifth wheel and although we had stated in our request that we had slides the site wasn't wide enough. Because the owner felt that my husband \"embarrassed her ' in the office by asking, she stomps down to the inferior site to continue the argument. When I asked her where we should park the truck she said on the grass, even tho right on the rules it says not even to put a mat on the grass and park on the patio so our slide would fit. We were ready to  unhook and she evicted us! We had accepted the site but she needed to be right and win! She said she had told us on our confirmation that it twas site three, well it's hard to tell what the site is truly like until you get there! Make sure you ask for EVERYTHING you want when you reserve so you don't upset the owner!  UNBELIEVABLE !!! hissy fit! Seen her upset before with  another patron and was crying and complaining to me outside my truck window because he yelled at her, which was unprofessional, to involve me because her feelings were hurt.",
      "Let's get this out of the way first... Yes, the toilets and showers are clean. In fact they sparkle. Day or night they were always clean and fresh.\n\nWe visited the Canyon RV Resort near the end of July 2017 at the end of our trip across western Canada.\n\nThe resort is a beautiful place to have a relaxing break.  The tin lids will love it. A beautiful shallow stream runs through the middle of park creating a dream playground for the adventurous ones.  For those less adventurous it is a wounderful setting for an evening stroll, crossing back and forth over the babbling brook as you work your way from one end of the park to the other.\n\nThe sites are generously sized. Many back right on to the stream creating a very relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  We stayed in \"Site #0\" - a perfect sized spot for our little RV.  Having stayed at the park, a site next to the stream will be our choice next time.\n\nThe park is lovingly maintained and is always clean. Not once did we spot a single piece of litter. There were lots of dogs in the park, however they are always on a lead and I don't recall hearing a single bark.\n\nCheck out the photos - they don't lie.  This is a beautiful resort with great managers and an obviously devoted and caring team.\n\nBrian J & Sherry T\nSydney, Australia",
      "Delightful site, good showers, laundry, very helpful staff. Trees and pretty planting, hard roads, no dust.\nBrook running through site disguises any noise there may be from road.\nWish we could clone it and install other places.\nBest site on our Canada trip so far.\nPity it was raining!!!",
      "Awesome park! Well kept, beautiful area. Friendly staff. Stayed 5 days and will be back. One of our favourite campsites."

      "It's a decent campground. The view is nice . It was very quiet. There are some full time trailers but you don't really notice them. It is 10 minutes from Town. We didn't talk to a single employee. Booked on line . There was a clip board out side the office with our site number on it, and no need to check in when leaving. The privacy between sites is zero, but they are kinda staggered so you get a little off set. We did not use the shower house's or washrooms .",
      "After reading the reviews, I feel lucky that I had a fantastic experience at Whistler RV. I went tent camping with my husband, my 5 year-old girl and an 8 month-old boy. We also noted that we had a large tent when booking in addition to having child and infant. The campground placed us with a large pad, beautiful tall trees at the background, and pretty close to the bathroom.  Can't ask for a better site for our family.  Customer service, they responded to my email query about fire ban and propane fire pit within couple hours and were courteous.",
      "Never stayed and never will even think about it again. I cancelled 8 days prior to arrival due to forest fires and the road in from our arrival destination was closed. They refused to refund me my money. I would have been better off cancelling the day prior. I would have gotten some sort of refund then. I was trying to be courteous so they could book out our site sooner...They are crooks as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure we were not the only people that cancelled and they were trying to save their profits for the season because of all the fires.",
      "The brochure and website for this park says 'free shuttle to village' and 'free wifi'. When we arrived we were told that the shuttle had not operated for 2 years, and that there was an $11 a day charge for wifi. When we told the girl on the front desk, she said that 'one of our companies hasn't updated it yet'. It's been 2 years... Also, all of the brochures in the Whistler Village Tourist information center (which had clearly been refilled recently) also made those claims. It was simply false advertising. Also, this park is no where near Whistler village. It was a good 10-15 minute drive which meant you also needed to pay the $30 a day RV parking charge at Whistler.",
      "While it is kind of like sardines in a can without much division between sites, the site was level with an amazing view.\nPeople were extremely quiet. No disruption of other people.\nWiFi is an extra fee. It is very hard to get in touch with an employee, by phone, or at the desk."

Beautiful sites, and many available during non-holiday periods (even the weekends don't fill this campground up). It's $20 per night, first come = first served. Very simple to fill in the form and make the payment anytime day or night. Check or cash works easily!",

      "This place was pitiful!!  The bathrooms were dirty and 3 of the 4 showers (two men's and 2 women's for the whole campground??) did not work. The fourth shower leaked so much the buildup of iron on the floor was totally unappealing.  And, you had to pay $5 for each shower!  Insects in the sink made brushing your teeth or washing your face a major challenge. The campground itself was mostly barren and open with no shade but lots of dust. Trash was all over!  There were a few okay tent camp sites but most were either too small or in the open. I had a paper that said the cost was $20 a night but they charged us $25, and there was no store or food available. Do not go here.",
      "As many people stated this is a beautiful campground. The woman checking us in was very friendly even though it was evening when we arrived. The RV and tent campground is down the paved road near the lake. The check-in office, nearby road and teepees are not visible from the campground. We had 50amp electric, water and sewer for $50 a night (no tax as this is on the Reservation). The ground, although a field and the very rainy weather when we were there) was very solid for our 35' RV and spacious. We had a view of the beautiful mountains. We had great Verizon service and no T-Mobile service. We enjoyed our stay!",

      "The staff was great and there's a lot of campsites to pick from. It does get really windy out here, and not much shade. If you don't take a shower by 5 p.m. expect freezing cold water. They say that the showers can have hot water enough for six different showers but it seems to be off by the time then the sun sets. The bathroom only has three showers. The center shower tends to be a shower for kids. The shower head is very low and there a very fim light to help.\nWhere we camped we ended up having a private beach. We had three fire pits to pick from and plenty of parking in the center. The staff was very helpful and accommodating for all of our questions. The washer and dryer were out of service at the time. One of the cheaper sites though! Very close to the park entrance and ten minutes down the road from general store and gas. (Sinclair,  also one of the cheaper had stations- credit card only!))\nI had verizon service.  Nothing for tmobil or sprint."

Get up for the sunrise and walk over to the east side to see it if you don't get a site nearby. Good prices for water and power and they even give you free firewood!!",

      "This is a great camp ground.  The facilities are clean and well maintained with free showers.  We were there at the beginning of June 2014 on a Saturday and Sunday night.  It was a busy Saturday night but not full (maybe 50-70% capacity) and there was a good vibe with everyone.  Great for young kids.  The river is not that nice as a swimming river but good to play on the edges of with two areas to access it from.  About a 30-40 minute drive to Mother Farm, and makes a good day out.  The staff were lovely and very friendly (Japanese speaking only).\n\nThey have fishing there but it is out of a concrete pond, not very nice.  I am not sure if you can fish in the river, but maybe worth bringing your own pole.",

      "ロッジを借りました！夏場のキャンプは、暑さに耐えられなかった事が有り、それ以来は、テントではなく、ロッジをかりてキャンプしています！冷房が、有るのと、無いのでは、大きな差が有ります！冷房があれば、爆睡できるからです。テントで宿泊している人たちは、ベテランの方かもしれません？ちょっと、ずるいかもしれませんが、私は、夏場は、冷房付きのロッジですね！撤収もらくです！",
      "連休の場合、一泊だけのキャンプはお断りしているとのこと。ホームページでの案内はありませんが、電話で言われ泣く泣く断念。二泊は事情により難しいため実質ここには行けなくなりました。いいキャンプ場なのに残念。人がたくさん来るようになって方針も変わったのでしょうか。",
      "よく整備されたキャンプ場です。\n管理棟の方たちも優しいおじちゃん、おばちゃんという感じで夕飯時に茹でたての枝豆などの差し入れをしてくれます。\n場内には自噴の無料の井戸があり、いつでも美味しいお水が飲めます。\nシャワーも無料で利用でき、二箇所あるトイレの一つはウォシュレット付きでとても清潔です。\nヤギや犬が飼育されていてヤギにおやつをあげることもできるので、子供たちも楽しめるかも♫"

      "This place began construction back in March of 2014 and was intended for week end  get away for Emily and Joe Flores.  It was also anticipated that friends and families will utilize this one of a kind recreation park so they built the main house using locally harvested building materials to maintain native appeal and functionality. The cooking area is in a 15 ft  X 30 ft building which also serve as function hall for hosting small to medium size group of guests. Three small cottages are also available to accomodate families and friends on occasional overnite  visits. This place is equiped with 200 feet  deep well using 1 hp submersible pump supplying enough potable water stored in 2000 liters elevated water tank. Due to intermitent power supply, an off grid solar power  system was installed capable of producing enough electricity that is stored in 1200 amp hours battery banks. This system provides all the needed electricity on all electrical appliances except the 1hp and 2hp  inverter type airconditioners during normal sunny days. For recreation, a 100 channel Cignal  tv satellite and internet  is provided by IG Sat Telecomunication using 2 meters satellite dish with ku band  LNB. Theres nothing exceptional on this system except it provides reliable internet service at 2mbps download and upload speed. \n     Last year the main house was damage by storm and it was decided to rebuilt using modern construction materials and a new building design. The new main house is a 2 bedroom, 3 bath with concrete slab as roof. Small section of the roof  provide storage for the solar batteries and laundry area.  Hot tub, fire pit, picnic tables and small barbeque grill are some of the wish list in the future. "

      "2017年5月のゴールデンウィークはココのキャンプ場を子供の友だち家族と共に利用しました。\n\n場所は、南房総の千倉駅近くの山間にあります。\n\n名前の通り元々、オレンジ畑だった場所を一部利用してキャンプ場になっています。\nなので、下から上までかなりの坂を登る必要があります。\n車に荷物を満載していると厳しいくらいの坂道です。\n\n敷地自体はかなりの広さがありますが、元々は畑だった場所なので、テントサイトそれぞれは余り広くは有りません。\n車とテントを一張りでいっぱいになる感じです。今回は複数の家族で利用したので、真ん中に共通エリアを作れましたが、単独でキャンプする人で気になる人は事前に確認をされた方が良いと思います。\n\nただ、南房総の山間に有るだけあって静かな場所なのでゆったりするには良いですね。夜はカエルの鳴き声位しか聞こえて来ないので\n\nあと、施設の特長ですが、ココは焚き火をするための薪が無料で提供されます。しかし、伐採した木から木材を切り出した余りを置いて有るだけなので、使う為には、ノコギリ、ナタ、斧などを持っていく必要があります。\nそれと、何故が運営スタッフからいろいろと貰えたりします。今回は、レモンやシメサバが配られました。\n\n初級のキャンプでは少し満足出来なくなった方にはオススメかも"

      "Anawangin Cove is a best place to spend with your friends or loved ones. There is no electricity or signal and it will give you more time to spend with them. Chat, talk, sing and play with them. The beach is clean, specially the end part of the curb on the right when facing the sea. We enjoyed camping and swimming.",
      "A beautiful cove that is slowly being discovered by tourists. No fancy amenities. Great place to go if you want to be one with nature. This cove used to be bare but after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, the ashes made the land fertile and 20 years later tall majestic pine trees adorn the serene landscape. A short hike inland would lead you to a beautiful waterfall. No hotels at the cove but anyone is welcome to pitch a tent and camp.",
      "Beautiful place. A wonderful experience to camp there overnight and get in touch with your inner girl/boy scout. The night sky is also different from what we see in the city.  It's also a great place to hang out with friends and not have the distraction of electronics. The place can get a bit crowded on holidays and the weekends. But I think that just adds to the fun. The more the merrier, right? However, there is a problem with a lot of people going to Anawangin and that is people tend to throw away rubbish all over the place. The campgrounds literally have trash bins all over the place but people can't be bothered to put their rubbish in the bins. For people planning on visiting Anawangin, please don't litter. It's a beautiful place and we'd like it to stay that way.",
      "Great place to camp. Great beach. Crystal Clear water. Very affordable. 50pesos day tour and 150 for overnight camper 👍",
      "If you are looking for a simple get way wherein you could camp for a change, you should include this one on your list. There's no electricity on the island so you could really enjoy the camping experience and bonfire during the night. We even collected our own firewood since what was provided on us will not suffice. You could also buy there, but the prices of the stuffs are too expensive which is reasonable I should say, because their investment is on its mode of transportation. Aside from the beach, another attraction is the mountain climbing which worth all the effort once you're on the top. "

Orman içine yapılmış, yürüyüş yolları, spor alanları çocuk parklarları, sosyal tesisleri  doğa ile iç içe vakit geçirme imkanı sağlıyor. Gölün çevresine yapılmış yürüyüş yolu kordon havasında. İrili ufaklı yüzen sazan balıklarını kenardan görmek mümkün. Mangal yapmak için güzel bir yer hafta sonları ve tatil günleri çok kalabalık. Ancak yinede park sorun olmuyor. Sosyal tesislerde fiyatlar ucuz değil. Örnek olarak dondurma 8 TL, çerez tabağı 10 TL. Tesis tamamlanmadan hizmete açıldığı için bir takım sorunlar var. Çocuk parklarındaki oyuncaklar daha kullanılmadan bozulmuş, bazı banklar kullanılmaz halde. Yine de Konya'nın en güzel mesire alanı.",
      "Konya Sille barajı Selçuklu Belediyesinin katkılarıyla piknik alanı olarak hizmete alınmış olmasına rağmen yetkililerin verdikleri bilgiye göre mesire yerinin tam olarak hizmete açılması 2018 Mayıs'ta yapılacak. Ancak bu haliyle yaşlı ve engelli vatandaşlar için tavsiye etmem. Çünkü mesire yerine arabanızla girmek yasak. Baraj alanına ücretsiz hizmet veren minibüslerle gidileceğinden yaşlı ve engelliler için çok zahmetli bir durum olarak görülüyor.",
      "Piknik alanına giriş ücretli ve arabanızı park yerine bırakıp kamelyalara parkta görevlendirilen araçlarla gitmek zorundasınız. O kadar piknik eşyasını bindir indir tekrar bindir tekrar indir çile stres. Yer de seçemiyorsun. Şoför seni nereye bırakırsa orda inmek zorundasın. Gördüğüm en saçma sistem.

Love that there were codes for entry and for the bathrooms and showers to stop outsiders from using facilities we had paid for. You can watch the sun rise over the dunes and we were fortunate enough to see the full moon rise over the water too. Absolutely lovely. Kitchen is large. Only a 3 min drive from the surf beach and 5 min from the golf course. Plenty of water activities to be done on the delta. Sand dunes were so beautiful.",

      "Our room was at least clean & it looks like the (tiny) bathroom has had a recent upgrade with new tiles & basin (but excluding the toilet & shower head). However there ends the positives. The bedding was woefully inadequate - we were COLD in the night - and there were neither extra covers nor an electric blanket available. The bed sloped to the sides and the furniture - plastic chairs - was extremely uncomfortable. Agree the $100 bond is ridiculous, and for the price, I would expect free Wi-Fi (or at least vouchers for a capped connection). We will be looking for alternative accommodation next time we're in Auckland.",

      "I would expect a lot more of a top 10 holiday park... Yes, the beach is very close and it is a great view, however the bathroom isn't that clean. I stayed in a basic cabin and there were ants all over the room. Definitely wouldn't recommend this cabin to anybody.",
      "Nice place to stay with family. Beautiful scenery face to the beach. Last month I try to  booking online, but on that webpage showed it was fully booked. I'm very fortunate when I rang them to confirm, they still have room for us. \nSo, the best way to book is thru phone call. Friendly staff will answer your call..",
      "Very expensive for off peak camping.\nIf you want peace and quiet..... this is not the place to come. \nBeautiful beach",
      "Fantastic place to relax and enjoy a night or more on site... whether it be in a tent, cabin, caravan or campervan... there's plenty of room and caters for everyone. 200% guaranteed.  ",
      "A great spot right on the beach with direct beach access. Well maintained amenities. Friendly and welcoming staff and a okay rate for an overnight stop. Also close to Auckland so good if heading north or south. Be sure to get up and see the sun rise."

      "Very bad campaign not friendly staff and dirty kitchen and showers",
      "Pinewood is a great park there are a decent amount of grass spots in the main area of the camp and a varied mix of grass and asphalt spots up in the hill that are spread out between the large amount of cabins and permanent campers (try to stay in the main area if possible) there are a couple of ablution blocks with free unlimited time showers and smaller kitchens, there is however only one dining area. It's only a short walk to the beach and surf club, there is a decent Chinese takeaway and a four square only a five min walk away and Auckland is an easy drive for day trips if you want that sort of thing. The prices are reasonable and the owners are friendly and I'd stay there again if I'm around the area.",

Unlike most of RV parks here there is lots of folage including trees, plants, etc. so it feels more intimate than setting up in those sand RV parks. There is electric in each site with a clean laundry room and bathrooms/showers are well maintained and plenty of water spigots and good wi-fi. I think it is the closest RV park to downtown Mulege and it sits across the street from the Rio Mulege so a nice view from the park. There are houses and trailers that can be rented as well.",

Staff was friendly and cooperative; could not say the same for many of my neighbors. There was not much peace and quiet to be had on the night I stayed, a Tuesday in July. Shrieking kids, grownups yelling at one another well into the night, and some nut who felt compelled to split wood well after the alleged quiet hour (10 PM).. \n\nThis was frustrating because the weather was perfect, the sky was full of stars, and the birds were calling to one another across the water. I would much rather have heard that instead of the needless racket all around me. May try again; this place is potentially lovely.",

There was good fishing off the fishing dock.  The manager was friendly.  The restroom and shower facility was dirty. There was no dump station on site. I would go back, but I am not sure my wife would."

He says you must not camp much this site is reserved.   I said excuse me but the card was flipped up as open.  He says can't you see that tag with dates on it? I said all I see is a white piece of paper with two numbers but who knows what that is.  He then well that is dates it is reserved.  I ask him how are we supposed to know that? He said well you don't camp much.   I said never mind we are packing up and never coming back and leave me alone. He drove off then come back and apologized and wanted me to stay at a different spot.  I tenitively agreed was not happy.   The next day even following the rules about hanging tags on the post the way the rules say to the next ranger ripped me for hanging one tag on top of the other.   I told him we are pulling out and never coming back.   So sad it seems like a good spot but the rangers are rude.    Not to mention there is no dump they want you to go to town and dump at the court house.   Crazy!!!!    Don't waste your time going here.",
      "Good place for camping although the fishing isn't great. There is no drinking allowed at this state recreation area and rules are enforced so be careful. Also a good place for boating as it's not a 5mph-no-wake lake."

      "Had a great two night stay at Burlington Bay Campground. Love how close it is to town and the state parks around. The view of the lake is great from almost every site. The dogs enjoyed the water access as well. The only downsides is it is right next to a busy freeway and they could use bigger bathrooms, as there was usually a line for the showers. ",
      "I called this s morning just before 10:00 and left a voicemail asking them to call me,  following their directions in their message. We we're looking for tonight, Thursday and Friday night. Their message stated they would call back in the order of calls received. \nI realize it's coming into the Labor Day weekend but their website said they still had sites available. It is now 6:16 P.M. And still no call. Since they state that they don't answer the phone and to leave a message you'd think it would be good P.R. to do what they say even if it's to say sorry we are full. ",
      "This is a beautiful campground in Two Harbors that we stay at a few times every year.  We were just up here for the 4th of July and it was incredibly busy but amazing.  We stay in a fifth wheel and two of the loops in the main campground do have full hook-ups with 30 amp electric.\n\nThey recently added another set of campsites catering to big-rigs across the street.  These have full hook-ups with 50 amp electric and we'll be trying these out next year.\n\nIt's really easy to get in here in the early spring and late fall; but make sure to make reservations early (at least one year ahead of time) if you want to come up over a holiday weekend.\n\nMany of the sites have beautiful views of Lake Superior and easy access to a beach.  There is a very nice paved trail to downtown Two Harbors and it's also just a short walk to all the eateries along Hwy 61.  \n\nThe campground does have a couple bathrooms and showers for those who aren't traveling in a big RV; these are okay but nothing special.  \n\nOne of our favorite campgrounds!!",
      "Campground overlooks Lake Superior and has a set of steps leading down to the water. No real beach area; water comes within a few feet of the steps. However, there is a public beach about a half block up the road with wonderful views and both rocky and sandy areas. Clean bathrooms. Not secluded sites. Very convenient to Two Harbors sites and restaurants. Pretty little town. Make sure you visit the lighthouse and breakwater/jetty.",
      "Love, love everything about this campground. We stay here every summer during Independence Day. It is not a campground for people who want the great outdoors but we enjoy riding our tandem down to Old Hwy 61 and and peddle to the Mocha Moose Coffee Shop or walk in to town via the lake. The fireworks on the bay are amazing. Of course there is also Canada on July 1st and you can watch how our neighbors to the North celebrate down here. :)"

      "We liked the actual campground. The staff was great and helpful when we needed them. Ice on site. We aren't big on super primitive camping so we didn't mind that there wasn't a ton of privacy between each camp site. However, it is right on a busy road and it gets pretty loud. The lake is close and there's a nice little beach to hang out on. The bathrooms are super clean and we'll stocked. Overall, we would stay here again. The factors that we didn't like are things that can't be controlled. It was affordable and we had a good time!",
      "There is no better campground on the north shore. You might go for a place to camp, but you'll stay for the experience. The owner is the experience... knowledgeable, friendly and full of stories.",

The hosts are great, friendly and helpful. Larry and Karen and Barbara and George have been hosting here for many years so they are also a great  source for local information.  The city is very quaint place. There have very nice parks and rec facilities. Also the location of Frank Lloyd Wrights only gas station. Getting to Duluth is quick from here as I35 is just a couple of miles away.  Yes, we loved our 10 days there.",
      "Very nice, well maintained,  campground. Bathrooms/showers were very clean with hot water. Nice setting, next to the river,  with many walking trails nearby. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. Very impressed, would stay there again.",
      "Nice campground and facilities, campground hosts were accommodating.  But the noise and disturbance from the ATVs driving through the park, the USG plant and trains blowing their horns all hours of the night south of the campground we're much less than desirable.  If you're looking for a quiet campground choose somewhere else.",

We had never signed an EFT form. When I asked the person at the front desk why we were charged automatically, I was told that she knew it was illegal and that it wasn't her that did it.... that it was another worker who'd done it.\n\nWe were leaving after that month and she said she'd take our information out of the system, so I didn't take any further action.

The only shower and toilet facilities currently is in a trailer, 2 rooms, each has a shower and a toilet and there's no additional space to do hair or makeup so we left the door open while fixing hair etc so someone needing to \"go\" wasn't held up by our preening. The laundry facilities are well maintained and very inexpensive! The staff was very pleasant.  I look for this to be a really decent place in the future, for now, it meets the needs of someone passing through and the price is fair. ",
      "Very nice manager but little to nothing at this KOA other than an overly lit and distrubing, like a outdoor movie lot in the dust in which to park. There were 2 showers which were decent. Dog run was wet, not a good combo with sand and wind unless you enjoy mud clad dogs in your RV. In high winds avoid this park at all costs."

      "My family and I Stayed there for the recent labor day weekend.. it was very nice.. lots to do and very friendly staff.. They had wine tastings which my wife and I did.. excellent wines and my wife and I aren't wine drinkers but the women who did the samples was so friendly and knowledgeable and inviting we couldnt say No.. They had pancake breakfasts  which was great for us cause it saved me from having to do dishes and cook...The staff really took good care of us..if we do come that way again this would be a place we'd come back to.. Only reason it's a 4 star and not a 5 star is because I wasn't a fan of the placements of the firepits.. late at night sitting in chairs right next to the road just doesn't seem like a good idea..otherwise great experience",
      "Very well maintained.  Kid and pet friendly.  Easy access.  Scheduled activities.  Wifi. Laundry , showers, heated pool and several play areas.  Little store with some necessary items.  Bike/walk path in front of campground with views of lake  (private ),but allow to go to the dock and sit and swim. Awesome sunsets over the corn fields.  Would stay again ",
      "This is just down the road from r home so we never thought to stay until invited by boy-scouts for there yearly camping here. I was very impressed. We camp here many times a year now. We get cabins, sit around fire in evening, cook on fire, kids swim, ride bikes, they have activities through out day for kids, play ground great, pools great, safe, friendly. We will continue to come back.",
      "We stay here several times a summer.  Wonderful, clean and family friendly.   The owners and staff are always ready to help and make sure your stay is enjoyable.   One if our favorite places to enjoy a weekend."

Unless you only like to sleep from midnight to around 6am when the idiots with their load mufflered pickups, motocycles, and little shitbox cars seem to get off the roads, you better bring earplugs!!

This is a small campground tucked into a corner of a mobile home park.  You're right next to the road, so there's quite a bit of traffic noise.  The advantage to that though is that you have easy access to the city (El Paso) and to stores.  There is also a train nearby. The sites are on level concrete pads with  a gravel area for your car and a concrete patio.  The bathroom/showers are large and clean.  The laundry is also clean and has three washers ($1) and three dryers ($1).",
      "Lately they just raise the space rents and the do not fix up the place. The lighting on the streets are always off cause they are old and dont change them, plus the streets are not paved nicely and have a alot of pot holes. They are after you to maintain your space nice and clean but they dont worry about keeping the whole park looking nice them selfs. Owner does not come around once in a while to see how everything is going it look like if he only cares about the money he collects! Think about it twice before wanting to come live here.oh yeah and by the way they always shut down the water for the whole park and leave us residents with out water for hours because of the bad pluming the park has because its all old and rusted!! And the owner doesnt give a dam about anything just pay up!!"

We did not know that the common building had a community kitchen with fridge - so unfortunately for us I threw away our food before we got to Halls in prep for a plane trip for work out of this area.  So while there is no electric at the sites, there is in the building. It was also a perfect spot to store the RV while not staying there with their rates. We felt very safe doing so.  The common building was also perfect for work reports. We used the table and had electric for computers, wifi's, and loved the peace and quiet this spot gave us.  We also enjoyed the humming birds visiting the flowers outside the windows. The \"port-a-potty\" shower was fine! cleaner that most.  The owners always answered my phone calls.  If you want a sweet spot for just one night or a get-a-way Hall's is wonderful!",

There's a fenced area playground for the kids.  It is economically priced for organizations that receive discounts  for using the Roadrunner RV park. The lot is entirely gravel. I would give it a 3.5 star rating, but rounded it up to four stars.  The town of Deming has an older original section , that has kept its old western character.",

Looks like the park and the two adjacent parks accomodate winter visitors. Some older looking rv's that are full timers, but we felt safe. Bonus for our 5 year old granddaughter was the tidy little playground that has fairly new and barely used equipment. She was so happy!",

Some sites are very close, but ours was nice and roomy.  It was also very level.  There's a nice clubhouse with a pool table, sitting area and book exchange."

I knew it would be a noisy location with the highway but the cargo train ran so close and loud all night it shook my entire RV and woke us up every time it went by.

      "Stayed here in a camper van for 1 night in late September.\n\nThe camp site is located inside the town, which is good if you want to visit nearby cafes or restaurants (of which there are not that many in Egilsstadir), not so good if you're looking for a more rugged or scenic camping experience.\n\nThe site itself was busy when we camped here and we basically couldn't fit inside to use any of the inside facilities other than bathroom/showers the next morning.\n\nThe bathrooms facilities were not very clean, but reasonable given the amount of traffic; Multiple toilets and showers are available for both men and women with plenty of hot water. I found the showers sorely missed a rack or dry area to place clothing and get changed.\n\nThe camp area itself is a flat, open, grassy field. Not bad but also not much in the way of wind shielding or privacy.\n\nThe staff at reception were nice and I was able to pay by card or cash.",
      "Good campsite with good amenities. There is a laundry facility on site. Nice bathrooms, showers are free to use if you're staying at the campsite. There is a big common area with a TV and plenty of plugs for charging electronics. Cafe next door and some other restaurants within walking distance.",

WiFi is 400is.\n\nHave a common room where to hang out on rainy days and eat.\n\nThey offer lots of information, including road conditions and weather in Iceland.\n\nIs in bus station.",

It's worth spending time to discover Seydisfjordur.",

However, the toilets, showers, kitchen and washing area are all filthy. All the trash bins are completely full of trash. Definitely something to take into account. Showers are 100ISK for 90 seconds.",

Se mostraron irrespetuosos cuando les solicitamos educadamente que bajaran el alto volumen con el que estaban celebrando a pocos pasos de las carpas. Nos dijeron que esto \"era Colombia\", que si queríamos podíamos mover las carpas del lugar que ellos mismos nos habían indicado previamente. Cuando nos fuimos, seguían increpando que esa era su casa y lanzaron insultos como \"come tierra Argentina\", asumiendo que éramos de este respetable país. NO RECOMENDABLE EN ABSOLUTO. ",

      "This is probably the nicest located of campsite we stayed at on our trip to Iceland. It's in this lovely wooded area (a rarity for Iceland) and it's quite large so you can set up your tent far away from everyone else. The only issue here is amenities, this campsite has no showers and no real kitchen area but does have bathrooms that seem to be reasonably well kept. In as few words as possible it's a lovely area to stay, there are nice hiking paths and a lovely rock beach and so so many trees, well located trash cans and several picnic benches to eat at but the amenities could be better. I would still wholeheartedly recommend staying here on a nice sunny day and just relaxing like we did though :)",

It has a playground for the little kids & lots of hiking trails or climbing hills or trees for the bigger kids, restrooms very accessible & are clean & neat, there is also water anywhere you are on the site. The views on any directons are just amazingly beautiful. I can stay there if it was not so far from where I live.\nMy favorite campsite around Iceland so far...",

      "This place is absolutely amazing. The staff are really friendly and accommodating. The hot tub was so lovely in the evenings along with our Jumbo pod, perfect for a couple. We were only there for 2 nights, however 3 would have been perfect. We went bike riding which was amazing, just a shame we didn't fit more in. Can't recommend this highly enough!",
      "The Wigwam accommodation was more than adequate. I was not expecting five star,  but what I got actually surprised me. Warm, comfortable, clean, well fitted out with a good fridge and microwave,  although the kettle was in need of replacement and spacious. I was on my own, space may be a little tight for a small family, but with the decking, picnic area seating and fire pit outside there would be no need to spend much time inside apart from sleeping. A peaceful site,  no loud music or boisterous groups, no late night gatherings to disturb the feeling of pure countryside. The sky on a clear night is absolutely stunning.\nThe kitchen area, showers, toilets and eating facilities are of a very high standard and while I was there were being further improved. \nCoarse Fishing is what I came for and that's what I got. Only found the need to use the coarse pool during my week long stay,  with an average of 7 fish a day over 6lb, and many more smaller than that who would want to move to the specimen pool. Best fish being a common carp of 10.7lb. Plenty of mirror carp and tench also.  Only one drawback,  and it is a personal one,  is that keepnets are not allowed. I fully understand why,  but I like to see what my daily catch is. Perhaps as well as insisting only site landing nets are used,  the same could be done for keepnets or dipping facilities supplied that are obligatory. Still nowhere is perfect,  but Gorsebank comes very close to it. It gave what it said, and what I expected and more.\nThis a great place to come to for many reasons and purposes,  not just fishing. That's my personal pleasure. The surrounding area and great Solway coastline on the doorstep make a superb destination for everyone.\nBooking further holidays here as soon as I get home. Sorry it came to an end.",

      "We have camped pretty much all our lives and this is among the best sites we have stayed on. It has flat pitches throughout  (a must if you're staying a long time) and a nice modern and clean kitchen area with washing machine and freezer for ice packs. The toilets and showers are spacious and always clean and there is a family shower and toilet room, perfect for the disabled and those with young families. As well as doing the basics right, there is also a room with a pool table, books, board games and a TV. A wooden play area is perfect for keeping the children entertained for when you're cooking dinner or packing bags ready for the day ahead. And there is a sandpit, concrete games area with a basketball hoop and equipment for playing basketball, football and cricket. The concrete area also has had a shelter with tables and space for disposable  barbecues and they have plenty of small concrete slabs if you want to have a barbecue by your tent or caravan. Add to this stunning views of the picturesque Scottish countryside and loads to do locally and it really is the perfect place to spend a summer holiday. The owners  are also very helpful.",
      "We have stayed here twice now and it is a brilliant camp site. The pitches are level and well spaced. The views are pleasant and there is plenty around to keep everyone happy. They have a children's adventure play area and a TV room with a pool table to entertain on those inevitable dreich days. The facilities are excellent. The showers have plenty of hot water and are scrupulously clean and there is a large indoor washup area with plenty of sinks and washing up liquid supplied. There is a freezer supplied for customers to freeze cool packs etc. The washers and dryers are large and reasonably priced. If you are looking for a big noisy site with swimming pool and night time entertainment then this is not for you. If you are looking for a base that is comfortable and beautifully maintained at a great price then this is the place to come.",
      "This is a small quiet family friendly camp site for tents touring caravans and motorhomes. Owners are extremely welcoming and helpful and the facilities very clean & tidy with plenty of hot water for showers, washing up and laundry.\nWe have spent a week here and would certainly recommend the site as an excellent  location for visiting the attractions in this part of Dumfries & Galloway.",
      "This is a small (ish) campsite that is family owned and is very well looked after. I was greeted by Lesley who showed me the pitches as well as the facilities that they have.\nThe toilets and showers are extremely clean and new. The block is warm, warm water always available. Lovely warm tv / common room to sit in and read. They offer plenty of tourist literature for the wide local area; A small library of books should you need something to read; there are board games and a pool table for the kids. There are also washers, tumble dryer,  washing line, washing up area, covered cooking area,  freezer and other electrical items available\nFresh farm eggs are available if required. The ground is level and well drained and is in a lovely quiet part of the country.\nDefinitely worth a visit and a stay.",

The hot tub outside was a nice touch to help unwind too. \nSome might be concerned as you are in the middle of a working farm but we loved seeing the baby cows!",
      "This place is lovely. Nice soft ground for pegs. Nice clean showers and toilets music in them too. Lovely people can't help you enough. Lovely sunsets. Firepits and wood are great. The only complaint I would have and this is nothing to do with the site. That seascale doesn't have any pubs 😲. Everything about the site though excellent 😀😀😀",
      "The owner of this cottage is very aggressive, he locked me in the cottage and shout very loudly in-front of my family and specially kids.  kids are still scarring since that day, and don't like to go outdoor holiday any more..... he was demanding more money, because of nail polish dots on the small table,... also on last night of our stay, he use to throw huge rubbish on my car park near Buffalo section of the cottage, also he park a big excavator to block my car, and after 2 hours we been released after making extra payment to him. I also reported to police when I come back to my home. try not to visit specially if you are family and with kids, Trust me... it was very terrible experience....",
      "My family and a family friend (plus our 3 dogs) had a fantastic short bank holiday weekend break at Shepherds Views and for once the Bank Holiday weather was great. Fantastic welcome by owners, they were really helpful before and during our stay, special thanks to Julie. Would recommend as pitches are large and they are well spaced so you have more privacy than most sites. Plenty to do in local area.",
      "A warning to campers thinking of visiting a site in The Lakes called Shepherds Views!\n\nWe took my 90 year old parents there at the weekend, booked them in to a holiday cottage next to our camping pitch and told the owners we would be visiting them throughout their stay to check they were ok.  The cottage was behind a 6 foot wooden fence with a courtyard in front. (View is the back of the reception office...imagine prison exercise yard!)  First night there we had an enjoyable evening, parents joined us at our campervan for a barbeque around the campfire.  When they returned to their cottage they were unable to flush the toilet as the mechanism was faulty. The following morning we went to the office to report the fault but the office was unmanned, so we went off for our day's activities.  When we returned dropped the parents off at their cottage and went to set bbq etc for the evening.  A short time later the owner of the site came raging across the field towards us, arms flailing,  shouting at the top of his voice, 'who's responsible for that lady at the cottage? Get over there and sort her out, she's been in my face, sort the woman out etc etc..' I went running over to the cottage not understanding how a 90 year old lady, who can hardly walk and with a bad heart condition could intimidate a burly farmer! The farmer came running after me, still shouting and waving his arms. The crime my mother had committed was reporting a fault at 6pm on a Saturday! He continued to rage at all of us for the next half hour, refusing to listen to anything we said and refusing to leave the cottage as he said it was his property and he could be there as long as he wanted.  I told him my mother was 90 and had a heart condition.  He replied 'I don't care how old she is or what her condition is, no-one gets in my face. He then told us we couldn't have a bonfire for the rest of our stay and if we did light the fire pit he'd charge us £4 . My mother was physically shaking and we became very concerned as she has a heart device fitted.  I reminded Mr Shepherd of this, but he continued to rage and try to intimidate us all.\nWe eventually got him to leave as we just all refused to say another word and just stood in a group and ignored him.  Mum and dad came over and joined us for the evening.  When they returned to the cottage they found a letter pushed through the door stating that 'No person other than the residents of the cottage should set foot in either the cottage or the courtyard..under any circumstances'.  As my parents carers and especially after their harrowing experience, we all obviously ignored this instruction!  How any person running a hospitality business can treat anyone, never mind two 90 year olds, in this way is beyond belief.  Incidentally, just in case you do decide to risk a stay at the cottage, the shower floods the wet room and the door won't stay shut and the toilet and shower block on site is unisex, bit uncomfortable when in there at night!\nShepherds Views Holidays, Holmrook,The Lake District...........Avoid!"

      "Always a lovely stay but could do with some modernisation. Hasn't changed in years",
      "Everyone absolutely raved about this place before they went and honestly I was less than impressed. \nFirstly we were camping with tents, we arrived late on Thursday night and had issues actually finding the pitch areas, some better signage would be good. We pitched on what we thought would be the best area (little fenced off parts). Now there's a reason they build windmills ontop of hills and in the highest places. I can't think for the life of me why they would put the pitching areas in the highest point of the park and the most exposed. The are was also absolutely littered with stones and rocks just under the surface and getting the tent up was a nightmare. We ended up moving further down off the hull beside a little burn which was much better. My only other complaint was that the entertainment provided at night was very non-kid friendly. Meaning that when they had bingo on they told the kids that they had to stay off the dance floor and not run around. Generally just felt very unfriendly and I would probably not recommend the place or camp there again. ",

      "Beautiful views of the Rough Firth and easy access to the coastal path from the site. Receptionist very helpful and advised us where to camp to get the best shelter as high winds were forecast. \nThe lower part of the site does get a bit wet but the facilities are clean and well maintained. The shop in Colvend is well stocked and is a 25 minute walk each way or a short drive.",
      "Only stayed here for two nights but we loved it. Friendly welcome, clean toilets & showers, amazing views. Free wifi great TV reception. All in all a very nice place!",
      "Really beautiful setting. Wonderful views. Not cheap, but very good amenities",
      "Just had a great three night stay. Superb views and sunsets from the tent field. \nWe would happily return.",
      "Loved it here. Perfect location, staff very friendly. Would definitely return."

      "This was our first time in Scotland & the first place we stayed. We both loved it. The owners really made us feel welcome, the site itself is great & the location is beautiful, of all the campsites we visited while in Scotland, this is the most memorable one. Would recommend 110%",

      "Clean site and very friendly staff. Pool is a decent size and temperature. Great for the kids to have a splash about. Nice food served in the bar and decent prices. Two parks for the kids and lots of open space. Games rooms ideal for older kids and a bit of soft play for younger ones. All in all a lovely small site for a family get away.",
      "Money grabbers they charged me ten pound extra for my family to just have 15 mins in jacuzzi when I asked for it back she told me to go somewhear else but kids wanted to go in so we went in enjoyed it even though it was freezing my 6 year old stepped in jacuzzi for 2 mins and she came at us wanting the money back after she had 30 pounds out of us for an hour n half swimming we were going to stay n have a meal there n probably have spent a further 50-60 pound there but with her language at us putting our swimming things in car we were distraught by this angle was overall the worse experience any wear also has no lifeguard and filthy toilets what would happen if a child was to get in great difficulty in the pool and you have no one supervising just a old woman which seemed to have Alzheimer's who actually left to go outside for several minutes who actually was an inexperienced receptionist .they came across to be desperate for money and were not happy with the money they received also if you are planning on taking your baby there are no baby changing facilities and had to change my baby on my knee he was soaked and the floors were 3 inches deep with water no one there like other pools brushing water down drains.. one elderly lady in charge of pool the soft play  the jacuzzi the reception absolutely illegally run Celine caving in above jacuzzi .health n safety needs to visit asap.",
      "Freezing pool for kids,no lifeguard which is a great concern ,one elderly lady incharge of reception ,arcade,soft play area, most of all the swimmingpool there was only her there to watch everything and im not confident in thinking she is a trained life guard infact she seemed to have mental health problems witnnesing her swaring at a customer begging for some money or she would loose her job infront of a few very young children who seemed troubled by their experience their parent was trying to get her children in car and she was just crazy leaving the reception arcade and a pool full of children. I am not experienced in dealing with anyone who drawns so it was a concern if my son was to drawn there would be certainly a death. Im sure they are breaking public health and safety rules.dont be so greedy and employ staff before there is a serious accident and the floors a puddled with water just a matter of time before some one breaks there kneck and you would be liable and be in further money problems and your roof looks like it is going to come inside the pool. Disgracefull this day and age . I did not stay long woth my son when i realised there was no life guard .",

      "Southerness is a great wee place. People are friendly. Been coming here since 1971.However, caravan was stinking of wet dog. Seats were very stained,  windows were covered in dried  dog saliva. Cleaning not up to standard. Had to buy cleaning equipment to do it myself.Freezing cold. Gas fire not working and room heater not working.  We lasted 3 days out of our week and had to leave. We would go back but not to a van that allows dogs.",
      "Very comfortable and clean accommodation. Friendly staff and lots to do. WiFi is reasonably priced but very poor signal and the landing page doesn't work properly so better to use it on tablets and laptops that don't have a sim in them. Location is lovely, very quiet though the Mermaid Bar is quite lively. Great for families with kids or a quiet weekend for grownups.",
      "A great place to relax and unwind - lovely area to explore and locals are really friendly and polite. The staff are very welcoming and friendly and go that extra mile to make your stay an enjoyable one. Food served in the attached restaurant is of a good standard and portions sizes are fair - prices are not over inflated like most caravan parks, entertainment was moderate to good. Swimming pool was great, consisting of a slide that extends through to the outside of the building and back in. Our only let down was the caravan itself - we stayed in the Teviot model which is one of the more 'luxurious' caravans available. Although it was fairly spacious and well furnished the caravan itself had a very worn and dirty feel about it. For example the seating area in the man lounge was extremely dirty and heavily stained as well as the carpet that was obviously the original. The stains were a mix of general dirt and under a UV light glowed up like a Christmas tree. Other items that let it down included damaged blind pulleys, missing edges from the worktop and surfaces, broken and unsafe stools, dirty walls, missing items from the inventory and high noise levels at night and early hours of the morning - not ideal for those who have young children wanting to sleep. Overall we enjoyed our stay but could have been better. We will be posting a video review of the park and caravan on Youtube so be sure to check it out.",
      "We have stayed in Southerness for a week and I can truly say it's horrible! When we arrived we got a filthy old stinking caravan. When we complaint at reception we found out there were other with similar problems. We got moved to other but similar old caravan. Never I was given the impression I was taken seriously by staff. Refund was declined. You are looking for a run down park, over priced old caravans with unhelpful staff? This is the place for you. For sure, we will never come back! ",

      "I went to Solway with my partner and 4 year old son. On arrival after a long drive my son need the toilet, so I took him into the disabled toilet (only one in the bar I could find) and to our surprise it was covered in blood! Literally all over the sink, floor and some on wall, I didn't even let my son wash his hands as it was the cleanest option. We went to our pitch (we were camping) and set up. The outdoor park was great, the soft play area needs a deep clean but my son enjoyed it. In the arcade part pretty much everything was broken and some machines took your money and didn't work , so this section was just a waste of time. The main problems came at night, despite it being quiet time from 10pm, this was far from the case, if anything it got 10 times louder. Lots of drunks arguing and shouting, we saw one couple in the trees having a quickie and the second night, the people who were stopping in tent next to us got hammered, was arguing, fighting and then while all were drunk, decided to get into the car and drive ( pretty much straight into our tent!) Considering there was a four year old in there asleep I was pretty shaken, and the fact they had been screaming at each other and psychically fighting and no security came or even walking around to check the place is secure and settled. I can overlook certain aspects like the general hygiene, after all it is camping. But some drunken idiots nearly knocking our tent with my son inside is another thing. \nThis camp site is perfect for people who want to party but wouldn't advise for the safety of your kids!",
      "Possibly generous. Accommodation we went for was a 3 bed lodge with hot tub. Good size for 6 people, decent size living/dining, but very dated. Weird attempt to spruce up in one bedroom, ill fitted wall paper of a forest. Carpets lifting throughout, dodgy toilet seat and very dated bathroom. Kitchen quite poor, shabby not chic. Oven didn't really work, and a small fridge, right behind the door so you got hit if any one tried to get in whilst you were hunting in the tiny fridge.\n\nNot too keen that I have to use a coin slot for electric on top of the price of the \"lodge\". The hot tub is good,but the shower is on the opposite side of stalag 6, sorry lodge. \n\nThe facilities at the park are great....for the gulls to breed. The owners seem to actively encourage the noise birds in their 100's.  The pool is small but not accessible for wheelchair users, the entertainment is up steep stairs and we were told we couldn't get up in a wheelchair. Then we were told the bar staff could carry it up with our disabled daughter. PASS. \nWould I come back....\n\nSilloth has got something...it is unique..don't let this put you off.\n\nThe park could be good with some drive and a bit money WISELY....hot tubs in lodges....mutton dress as lamb.",
      "Stayed earlier this year in what I thought was the beginning of the peak season. Was given the keys to 3 different chalets.  All were dirty and 1 was a health risk with all of the mould. We were then given a caravan which was fine  . The site wad dirty. The public toilets were dirty. About a third of the machines in the amusement arcade were not working.  The place was that bad that we left early. We will definitely NOT be going there again or will be recommending the camp.",
      "This is a basic Caravan and chalet park, which is good for a long weekend. Caravans are in the process of being upgraded, good kids entertainment in the evening, nice swimming pool with baby and toddler pond. Alcohol priced at £3.70 for a pint of larger, £5.70 a large glass of red wine in the entertainment area. We did not eat in the restaurant/bar. We stayed in a new caravan for a few days and had a great time. It was worth it on the deal we found, though I cannot comment on the lodges... Silloth is a lovely town to spend a couple of days in if the weather is good.  ",
      "Visited here with family and daughters friend recently. Stayed in Chalet which was terrific size and clean and adequate for our needs. Was pet friendly too. It could need upgrading in certain areas but you need to remember it's not the HILTON. Lots to do on park and pool was great. Entertainment decent and staff great and friendly. Tried food also which decent and not too expensive. The park was central and good for exploring the coast."
