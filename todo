When do you add a rating?
-- When a user creates a new campground, they should have an option to rate it
---- On the show page, show campground rating and user rating
-- When a user views a campground, they should have an option to rate it
-- The user should be able to change the rating dynamicallly



-- When a campground is created: It has an initial rating (set by user who created it)
-- Each campground should keep track of all its ratings. 
-- When a user rates a campground, that rating should be added to the campgrounds rating array, and the actual avg rating updated
-- Each user should keep track of how he/she rated campgrounda


Sooo

Campground has a ratings array
A rating consist of a number and a author

When a campground is created, insert a single rating into its array 

Does author need to keep track of ratings? Nah...
