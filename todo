When do you add a rating?
-- When a user creates a new campground, they should have an option to rate it
---- On the show page, show campground rating and user rating
-- When a user views a campground, they should have an option to rate it
-- The user should be able to change the rating dynamicallly




1. Create ratings post route
2. Create ratings edit route
3. In a campground's show page, if user left a rating for this campground, show the user's rating
4. Investigate campground destroy route - do we need to delete ratings too?
5. Move rating code to its own js file
